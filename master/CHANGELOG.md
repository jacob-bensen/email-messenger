# Changelog

## 2026-05-21
Shipped: Inline upgrade modal over the thread list when a `PlanLimitExceededException` is thrown during a controller-driven import — replaced the standalone 402 error page with a redirect-and-flash flow: `GlobalExceptionHandler.planLimit` now writes a serializable `UpgradeModal` record (currentPlan / kind / limit / current / upgradeTarget=PERSONAL) into the output `FlashMap` via `RequestContextUtils.getOutputFlashMap` and 302s to `/threads`, so the user lands back in their own inbox with the modal on top instead of a disconnected error page; `threads.html` renders a dimming overlay + plan-comparison card (Free current vs. Personal recommended, with live "N of N threads" copy from the exception's `current`/`limit`) plus a CSRF-armed `POST /billing/checkout?plan=personal` "Upgrade to Personal" submit and a JS-only "Not now" dismiss; cleaned up `error.html` to drop the now-unreachable `upgradePlan` branches. Added modal CSS — overlay, card, two-column plan-compare grid (collapses to one column ≤ 520px), dark-mode overrides — alongside a fade-in animation. 2 new tests (1 `GlobalExceptionHandlerTest` verifying the redirect target plus full `UpgradeModal` flash payload, 1 `ThreadControllerTest` confirming the `upgradeModal` flash attr propagates into the inbox model); 135 total pass.
Advances: Milestone 4 (Plan limits) of EPIC-02 Monetization Plumbing.
Master action: none

## 2026-05-20
Shipped: Free-plan thread-count enforcement — added `Plan.FREE` to the plan enum, `PlanLimits` (Free: 1 mailbox / 500 threads; Personal: 3 / unlimited; Team: 10 / unlimited; Enterprise: unlimited), `PlanLimitKind` enum and a typed `PlanLimitExceededException` carrying current plan + kind + limit + current so the upgrade modal can render contextually; `PlanLimitService.currentPlan(user)` returns FREE unless the user's Subscription is in {trialing, active, past_due} (so `incomplete`, `canceled`, and a missing row all fall back to Free), `enforceCanCreateThread(user)` throws when `EmailThreadRepository.countByOwner(user)` is at the cap and is no-op for unlimited plans; `EmailImportService.resolveThread` now calls the guard only on the brand-new-thread branch so replies into an existing 500-thread mailbox still land; `BillingService.startCheckout` now rejects `Plan.FREE` early with a clean `BillingException` instead of falling through to "no price configured"; `GlobalExceptionHandler` maps `PlanLimitExceededException` → 402 Payment Required with an `upgradePlan=personal` model attribute, and `error.html` renders a CSRF-armed `POST /billing/checkout` "Upgrade to Personal" button when that attr is set. 13 new tests (9 `PlanLimitServiceTest` covering no-sub/incomplete/trialing/canceled/past_due plan resolution, under-cap pass, at-cap throw with full exception fields, paid-plan no-op, limits accessor; 2 `EmailImportServiceTest` cases for 501st-thread throws + reply-at-cap still appends; 1 `BillingServiceTest` for Free-rejected checkout; 1 `GlobalExceptionHandlerTest` for 402 status + upgrade CTA attr); 134 total pass.
Advances: Milestone 4 (Plan limits) of EPIC-02 Monetization Plumbing.
Master action: none

## 2026-05-19
Shipped: Stripe Billing Portal self-serve — `StripePortalGateway` (interface + SDK-backed `com.stripe.model.billingportal.Session` impl) exposes `createPortalSession(customerId, returnUrl)`; `BillingService.startPortal(user)` looks up the user's `Subscription`, returns `Optional.empty()` when no Stripe customer exists yet (so a never-paid user is funnelled to `/pricing` instead of erroring) and otherwise calls the gateway with the configured `billing.stripe.portal-return-url` (env `BILLING_PORTAL_RETURN_URL`, defaults to `/threads` in dev); added `BillingService.hasManagedBilling(user)` so the inbox header can light up a "Billing" link only when there's a Stripe customer to manage; `POST /billing/portal` (auth-required, CSRF-protected) 302s to the Stripe-hosted URL or to `/pricing` when there's nothing to manage; `threads.html` renders a CSRF-token form-post "Billing" button next to "Sign out" when `hasBilling=true`. 6 new tests (3 service: portal URL on existing customer, empty on no-sub, hasManagedBilling toggling from false→true after first checkout; 3 controller: anonymous→login, customer→Stripe URL, no-sub→`/pricing`); 121 total pass.
Advances: Milestone 3 (Trial + self-serve) of EPIC-02 Monetization Plumbing.
Master action: Stripe Billing Portal settings (return URL, customer-facing features) must be enabled in the Stripe Dashboard once test mode keys are in place; tracked under existing Stripe section in MASTER_ACTIONS.md.

## 2026-05-19
Shipped: Trial-status banner inside the inbox — `BillingBannerService` reads the user's `Subscription`, emits a `TRIAL_ENDING` banner with ceiling-divided days remaining (so 36h reads as "2 days") when status is `trialing`, a `SUBSCRIPTION_ENDED` lockout banner when status is `canceled`, and nothing otherwise; `ThreadController.listThreads` short-circuits the thread-list query when canceled so a lapsed user lands on a "Your subscription has ended — Reactivate plan" panel pointing at `/pricing` instead of seeing their old threads, and trialing users get a "Trial ends in N days — add card" callout (urgent styling ≤ 3 days, "today/tomorrow" copy at 0/1) on both `threads.html` and `conversation.html`; added a `Clock` bean so day-math is deterministic in tests. 10 new tests (7 unit tests across no-sub / active / trialing / partial-day / past-trial / missing-end-date / canceled, 3 controller tests for trial banner, lockout short-circuit, and conversation banner attribute); 115 total pass.
Advances: Milestone 3 (Trial + self-serve) of EPIC-02 Monetization Plumbing.
Master action: none

## 2026-05-18
Shipped: Closed the login-funnel gap so an existing user who arrives at `/login?plan=personal` (via the register page's "Sign in" link or any plan-tagged pricing CTA) is taken to Stripe Checkout after sign-in instead of `/threads` — added `PlanCheckoutSuccessHandler` (a `SavedRequestAwareAuthenticationSuccessHandler`) that reads the `plan` form param, calls `BillingService.startCheckout(user, Plan)`, and 302s straight to the returned URL, falling through to `/threads` on missing/unknown plan or `BillingException`; wired it into `SecurityConfig`'s `formLogin` in place of `defaultSuccessUrl`; `login.html` now renders a hidden `plan` input when present and its "Create one" link forwards the plan into `/register?plan=…`. 4 new integration tests (plan → Stripe URL, unknown plan → `/threads` with billing never called, login page renders with plan param) cover the funnel; 105 total pass.
Advances: Milestone 2 (Stripe billing) of EPIC-02 Monetization Plumbing.
Master action: none

## 2026-05-17
Shipped: Wired pricing-page CTAs into the funnel — `/pricing` Personal/Team CTAs now go to `/register?plan=personal|team` (Free goes to `/register`), `AuthController` accepts an optional `plan` query/form param on GET/POST `/register`, propagates it through binding errors and email-already-registered re-renders into a hidden form field, and after the existing `request.login(...)` auto-login it invokes `BillingService.startCheckout(user, Plan.parse(plan))` and `302`s straight to the returned Stripe Checkout URL; unknown/tampered plans and `BillingException` from an unconfigured Stripe fall through silently to `/threads` so a freshly-registered user is never stranded on an error page; `register.html` hidden plan input + plan-aware sub-headline + "Sign in" link now carries `?plan=` through, plus a `/login` GET handler stashes `plan` in the model so the follow-up login funnel work has a hook. 2 new integration tests (plan→Stripe URL redirect, bogus plan → `/threads` with `BillingService` never called), 102 total pass.
Advances: Milestone 2 (Stripe billing) of EPIC-02 Monetization Plumbing.
Master action: none

## 2026-05-16
Shipped: Stripe webhook handler — `POST /billing/webhook` exempted from auth + CSRF, verifies `Stripe-Signature` via `com.stripe.net.Webhook.constructEvent` against `billing.stripe.webhook-secret`, returns 400 on bad/missing signature so Stripe stops retrying; `StripeWebhookGateway` flattens raw events into a SDK-free `StripeEvent` record (customer, subscription, status, price, trial_end, current_period_end, with current_period_end fallback to subscription.items[0].current_period_end for the post-2024-09 schema); `BillingService.applyStripeEvent` is idempotent and dispatches `checkout.session.completed` (attaches subscription_id, flips `incomplete`→`trialing` when trial days configured else `active`), `customer.subscription.created/updated` (mirrors status / price / trial_end / current_period_end), `customer.subscription.deleted` (`canceled`); unknown customer / unknown event types are logged and swallowed to avoid retry storms; lookup tries `findByStripeSubscriptionId` first, falls back to `findByStripeCustomerId`. 10 new tests across handler dispatch and end-to-end controller (HMAC-signed payload through Stripe SDK verifier, rejected bad-sig stays incomplete, missing-header rejected), 100 total pass.
Advances: Milestone 2 (Stripe billing) of EPIC-02 Monetization Plumbing.
Master action: `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` must be supplied after deploy + endpoint registered in the Stripe dashboard (already tracked in MASTER_ACTIONS.md).

## 2026-05-15
Shipped: Stripe Checkout integration — added `com.stripe:stripe-java:32.1.0`, Flyway V4 `subscriptions` table (1:1 with users, unique stripe_customer_id/stripe_subscription_id), `Subscription` JPA entity + `Plan` enum (PERSONAL/TEAM/ENTERPRISE), `SubscriptionRepository`, `BillingProperties` (@ConfigurationProperties for secret key, four price IDs, success/cancel URLs, trial days), `StripeCheckoutGateway` interface with Stripe-SDK impl (subscription mode, 14-day trial, allow promo codes, reuses Stripe customer on repeat checkouts), `BillingService.startCheckout(user, plan)` that upserts a local Subscription row in `incomplete` state, and `BillingController POST /billing/checkout` that 302s to the Stripe-hosted URL; `BillingException` + `IllegalArgumentException` handlers wired into `GlobalExceptionHandler`; `/billing/cancel` is public, checkout requires auth. 7 new tests (gateway-mocked service flow + controller redirect/auth/unknown-plan), 90 total pass.
Advances: Milestone 2 (Stripe billing) of EPIC-02 Monetization Plumbing.
Master action: Stripe credentials still required — `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` and four price IDs (already tracked in MASTER_ACTIONS.md).

## 2026-05-15
Shipped: Made `EmailThread` user-owned end-to-end — Flyway V3 adds NOT NULL `owner_id` FK with index, scopes `root_message_id` and `message_id_header` uniqueness per-owner; `EmailThread.owner` JPA mapping; `EmailThreadRepository` gains `findByOwnerOrderByUpdatedAtDesc` / `findByIdAndOwner` / `findByRootMessageIdAndOwner` and `MessageRepository.findByMessageIdHeaderAndOwner` (JPQL join through thread); `ThreadController` resolves the current `User` via `Principal` + `UserService.requireByEmail` and filters list, view, and reply paths so one user cannot see or reply to another's threads; `EmailImportService.importMessage` now takes a `User owner` and threads stay isolated even when two users receive the same Message-ID. 9 new tests (cross-owner isolation in repo + controller + import), 83 total pass.
Advances: Milestone 1 (Auth foundation) of EPIC-02 Monetization Plumbing.
Master action: none

## 2026-05-14
Shipped: Spring Security email/password auth — `User` entity + Flyway V2 (users + persistent_logins), BCrypt-hashed registration via `/register`, form login via `/login` with persistent remember-me, logout, CSRF enabled site-wide and wired into the existing reply form; `/threads/**` now redirects anonymous users to login. 13 new tests, 79 total pass.
Advances: Milestone 1 (Auth foundation) of EPIC-02 Monetization Plumbing.
Master action: none

## 2026-05-06 — Autonomous Run #9

### Session Briefing (Role 1 — Epic Manager)

**Active epics this session**:
- `EPIC-01 Conversion Surface` (HIGH) — landing/pricing/demo pages so any
  organic traffic has somewhere to land. `/` currently redirects straight
  to `/threads`, which is the single biggest conversion gap.
- `EPIC-02 Monetization Plumbing` (HIGH) — auth + Stripe; the path to
  actual revenue. Blocked on Master credentials (Stripe, OAuth).
- `EPIC-03 Mailbox Onboarding` (HIGH) — IMAP polling + onboarding wizard;
  the path from signup to "aha" moment.

**Most important thing this session**: Build the static pricing page at
`/pricing`. It is the highest-priority unblocked task in EPIC-01, requires
no auth or external credentials, no DB schema changes, and unlocks every
marketing/distribution effort by giving traffic a real conversion target.
Every dollar of Master's eventual ad/SEO/social spend funnels through
pricing — without it, those dollars vaporize.

**Risks / blockers flagged**:
- EPIC-02 is gated on Master configuring Stripe (already in TODO_MASTER.md).
- EPIC-03's IMAP polling needs at least one test mailbox credential to be
  end-to-end verifiable; can be built behind a feature flag without one.
- 39 [GROWTH] tasks are queued; backlog needs Role 6 prioritization to
  surface the next-session pick clearly.

**Bootstrap notes**: Created `master/EPICS.md` (didn't exist). Synced
`master/APP_SPEC.md` to mark IMAP and Gravatar as planned (not built).

---

### Role 2 — Feature Implementer
**Task completed**: Static `/pricing` page [GROWTH][S] (EPIC-01 Conversion Surface)

Files created:
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/web/MarketingController.java` — package-private
  `@Controller` exposing `GET /pricing` → `"pricing"` view. Separated from
  `ThreadController` so marketing surface routing stays orthogonal to app routes.
- `src/main/resources/templates/pricing.html` — full plan comparison page:
  hero with H1 "Simple, predictable pricing" + sub; monthly/annual billing
  toggle (annual prices `$7 / $24 / $83` derived from APP_SPEC's "2 months
  free" rule); 4-column plan grid (Free / Personal *Most Popular* / Team /
  Enterprise) with check-marked feature lists, plan blurbs, and CTAs (Free
  → `/threads`, Personal/Team → "Start 14-day free trial" → `/threads` for
  now since auth/Stripe aren't wired, Enterprise → `mailto:sales@`); 4-item
  FAQ (`<details>` accordion: switching plans, free trial, mailbox limit,
  data handling); marketing footer with brand + nav links. SEO `<meta
  description>` set for the page.

Files changed:
- `src/main/resources/static/css/main.css` — +200 lines:
  - `.marketing` page container, `.hero-narrow` H1/sub
  - `.billing-toggle`/`.billing-option` segmented control with
    `.is-active` + brand-colored fill; `.save-badge` for "Save 16%"
  - `.plan-grid` responsive auto-fit (220px min); `.plan-card` with the
    `.plan-card-featured` variant getting brand border + lift transform +
    shadow + a "Most popular" `.plan-tag` ribbon
  - `.plan-name`, `.plan-price`/`.price-amount`/`.price-period`,
    `.plan-blurb` (40px min-height to align grid), `.plan-features` with
    ✓ pseudo-bullets, `.plan-cta` full-width button
  - `.faq` + `.faq-item` `<details>` styling (custom summary marker hidden)
  - `.marketing-footer` with link nav
  - `.nav-active` for current-page indicator
  - Dark-mode overrides for plan card, billing option, faq item, footer
  - Mobile `@media (max-width: 640px)` resets the featured-card lift and
    scales hero H1 down to 28px
- `src/main/resources/templates/threads.html` — added `<a href="/pricing">Pricing</a>`
  to the header nav so the new page is reachable from the inbox.

Inline JS on pricing page wires the billing toggle: clicking Monthly/Annual
swaps `.is-active` and rewrites every `.price-amount` from `data-monthly`
or `data-annual` attributes — pure attribute lookup, no template injection
risk. Uses `var` for IE-compat consistency with sibling templates.

Verified: `./mvnw test` → BUILD SUCCESS, 63 tests pass.

**Income relevance**: Pricing page is the entry point of every paid
conversion. Without it, marketing/SEO/social touchpoints have nowhere to
land. With it, every visitor who arrives via `/pricing` (the most common
top-of-funnel SaaS route) sees plan tiers, a featured "Most Popular"
anchor, a clear "Start 14-day free trial" CTA, and FAQ that pre-empts the
top objections. This unlocks every downstream conversion task in EPIC-01
and gives Master a real URL to share when posting in marketing channels.

**Note for next session**: CTAs currently route to `/threads` because auth
+ Stripe checkout aren't wired yet. Once user auth ships (EPIC-02), update
the CTA hrefs to `/signup?plan=personal` etc. so the pricing page becomes
a true conversion funnel.

---

### Role 3 — Test Examiner
**Coverage added**: 3 new tests, 66 total (up from 63)

New tests:
- `MarketingControllerTest.pricingPageReturnsPricingView` — covers the new
  `GET /pricing` route added this session (200 OK, view name `"pricing"`).
  Standalone MockMvc with the same `InternalResourceViewResolver` pattern
  used by `ThreadControllerTest`.
- `ReplyServiceTest.sendReplySetsInReplyToAndReferencesHeadersFromLastMessageId`
  — verifies that when the last message in a thread has a Message-ID
  header, the outgoing reply's `In-Reply-To` and `References` headers are
  set to that exact value. **Income-critical**: without correct threading
  headers, replies arrive at the recipient's inbox as orphan emails — they
  break out of the conversation thread, look like spam, and destroy the
  product's value. Previously untested; the existing tests only verified
  Subject/To routing.
- `ReplyServiceTest.sendReplyOmitsThreadingHeadersWhenLastMessageHasNoMessageId`
  — verifies that when `messageIdHeader` is null (e.g. an imported message
  with a missing or malformed Message-ID), `In-Reply-To` and `References`
  are *not* set (rather than being set to the literal string "null", which
  would be a silent corruption bug).

**Risk reduced**: Email threading correctness for outgoing replies — a
class of bug that would have shipped silently and only surfaced via user
churn ("my replies aren't threading, I'm cancelling").

**Still uncovered (not actionable this session)**:
- Stripe webhook handler — code not written yet (EPIC-02).
- User auth flows — code not written yet (EPIC-02).
- IMAP polling job — code not written yet (EPIC-03).
- Day-separator JS and keyboard shortcut JS — client-side; out of JUnit scope.
- Pricing page billing-toggle JS — client-side; out of JUnit scope.

---

### Role 4 — Growth Strategist
Identified 5 implementable growth ideas not previously captured, plus 2 Master
marketing actions:

1. **Smart reply suggestions** [GROWTH][M] (EPIC-05) — Claude-generated 2–3
   one-tap reply suggestions under each conversation; Personal+ tier gate;
   the strongest "wow" demo asset for screenshots and recording. HIGH income
   impact. Prereq: auth + ANTHROPIC_API_KEY.
2. **Exit-intent email capture modal** [GROWTH][S] (EPIC-01) — on `/pricing`
   and future landing, detect close/back intent and show "Get launch updates"
   modal; captures leads before Stripe is wired. MEDIUM income impact.
3. **Add-on extra mailbox at $3/mo** [GROWTH][S] (EPIC-02) — expansion
   revenue without forcing a tier upgrade. MEDIUM income impact.
4. **Auto-categorize threads** [GROWTH][M] (EPIC-04) — Newsletter / Personal
   / Work via List-Id + sender-domain heuristics; reduces "overwhelming"
   churn that hits at the 100+ thread mark. MEDIUM income impact.
5. **Public stats page at `/stats`** [GROWTH][S] (EPIC-01) — live
   server-rendered counters as a trust signal; compounds with pricing page.
   LOW–MEDIUM income impact.

Master actions added to TODO_MASTER.md:
- Submit MailIM to BetaList + Indie Hackers products page once pricing
  page is live (free, ~30 min, targeted SaaS-curious traffic).
- $50–$100 Reddit ads test on r/productivity / r/freelance / r/remotework
  landing on `/pricing`; pause-criteria included.

---

### Role 5 — UX Auditor
**Flows audited**: landing-equivalent (`/` → `/threads`), thread list, empty
state, conversation header, pricing page (just shipped), reply form.

**Direct fixes applied**:
1. **Empty-state dead-end** (`threads.html`): the "Connect a mailbox" button
   was `href="#"` — clicking it did nothing. Replaced with "See plans &
   get started" linking to `/pricing`. Empty state now drives every
   first-time visitor with no data toward the conversion surface instead
   of bouncing. Also rewrote the heading from "No conversations yet" to
   "Your inbox is empty" — clearer subject/object framing.
2. **SEO hygiene**: added `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">`
   to both `threads.html` and `conversation.html`. App pages should not
   appear in Google results both because they're per-user (no value to
   anonymous searchers) and because conversation subjects could be
   sensitive. `/pricing` deliberately has no robots tag (defaults to
   indexable) — it's the only page Google should rank.

**Issues flagged (added to INTERNAL_TODO.md [UX])**:
- Pricing page CTAs route to `/threads`; needs `/signup?plan=...` once
  EPIC-02 ships.
- Pricing footer needs `/privacy` `/terms` `/refund-policy` links once
  those pages exist (Stripe go-live blocker).
- Conversation page should also expose `/pricing` in the header.
- Mobile layout pass should also hide `.kbd-hint` below 640px.

---

### Role 6 — Task Optimizer
**Backlog hygiene:**
- Created `master/DONE_ARCHIVE.md` (didn't exist); migrated 19 completed
  tasks out of `INTERNAL_TODO.md` (the `## Done (archived)` section is
  now empty/removed) plus this run's pricing page completion.
- Rewrote `INTERNAL_TODO.md` from scratch with the prescribed priority
  ordering: `TEST-FAILURE → income-critical → UX(conversion) → HEALTH →
  GROWTH → BLOCKED`.
- Tagged **every** open task with its Epic ID (EPIC-01 through EPIC-08).
- Grouped GROWTH items by epic so the next session can read down a single
  epic's backlog without filtering.
- 0 `TEST-FAILURE` items; 0 `BLOCKED` items.
- Active task count: 47 tasks (1 CORE income-critical, 12 income-critical
  GROWTH, 7 UX, 24 GROWTH non-critical, 3 Infra). Down from 50 by way of
  the pricing-page completion plus 2 net adds (5 new growth – 1 done –
  some absorbed by existing slots; previous count likely undercounted).
- `TODO_MASTER.md` audit: the only `[LIKELY DONE - verify]` item is the
  HTML XSS sanitization, already verified in test suite (4 XSS tests in
  `ConversationServiceTest`); leaving the verify-in-production note as-is.

**Session Close Summary:**

What was accomplished Run #9:
- Shipped `/pricing` page (EPIC-01) — first marketing surface; 4 plans, monthly/
  annual toggle, FAQ, dark-mode + responsive CSS, SEO meta description.
- Added `MarketingController` with test coverage; reply-threading-header
  correctness now tested (income-critical anti-churn coverage).
- Bootstrap: created `EPICS.md` (8 epics; 3 active) and synced `APP_SPEC.md`
  to mark IMAP/Gravatar as planned (not built).
- Backlog: created `DONE_ARCHIVE.md`, rewrote `INTERNAL_TODO.md` with epic
  tagging and priority ordering. Added 5 new growth tasks + 2 marketing
  Master actions. Fixed 1 dead-end empty-state CTA. Added robots metas to
  app pages.
- Test suite: 63 → 66 tests, BUILD SUCCESS.

Most important open item heading into next session:
- **EPIC-02 user authentication** is the unblocker for at least 9 plan-gated
  GROWTH tasks (Stripe billing, plan limits, archiving, pinning, signature,
  custom from-address, AI summary, smart replies, Google OAuth). It is a
  single-session [M] task and once shipped opens the floodgates of revenue
  features. Recommend that be Run #10's Role-2 pick.

Risks / blockers needing Master attention:
- `TODO_MASTER.md` Stripe + DB + domain items remain outstanding. Without
  a Stripe account, EPIC-02 can be coded but not end-to-end tested with
  real checkouts.
- Reddit ads + BetaList submissions (added this run) are zero-cost and
  unblocked; can be done as soon as Master has a public URL.

---

### Role 7 — Health Monitor

**Security**:
- Hardcoded-secret scan across `src/**`: clean. Only references are the
  `application.yml` env-var placeholders (`${DB_PASS}`, `${MAIL_PASS:}`)
  and the empty H2 dev password — all expected.
- New `MarketingController` and `pricing.html` introduce no DB query, no
  user input, no `th:utext`, and no `eval`-style JS. Billing-toggle JS
  reads only `data-monthly` / `data-annual` attributes from the page's
  own DOM — no injection vector.
- **Pre-emptive flag added** to `INTERNAL_TODO.md` [HEALTH]: CSRF token
  must be wired into `conversation.html`'s reply form when Spring Security
  arrives in EPIC-02 (without it, existing POSTs will start returning
  403). Currently no Spring Security on classpath so no enforcement
  exists — known gap.
- **Pre-emptive flag added**: `/h2-console` is correctly gated by the dev
  profile in `application.yml`, but a CI/prod smoke check should verify
  it returns 404 in prod so a bad `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` can't silently
  expose the DB browser.

**Performance**:
- `/pricing` is fully static — zero DB queries, sub-millisecond render.
- CSS file grew from 412 → ~610 lines (~12 KB unminified). Still
  manageable; flag to watch as future marketing pages add more.
- No new dependencies; `pom.xml` unchanged.

**Code quality**:
- `MarketingController`: 11 lines, package-private — no over-engineering.
- `pricing.html` uses semantic HTML (`<article>` per plan, `<details>`
  for FAQ accordion); no inline styles; no template-injection risk.
- One small JS dead-branch was removed during implementation
  (`'period' === 'annual' ? ...` was a literal-string compare).
- CSS additions are namespaced (`.marketing`, `.plan-*`, `.billing-*`,
  `.faq-*`); no global selector pollution.

**Legal**:
- **Direct fix applied**: `pricing.html` FAQ originally contained
  forward-looking claims ("Mailbox credentials are encrypted at rest",
  "delete all your data with one click") that aren't yet implemented.
  Misrepresentation of un-shipped features is actionable under FTC and
  EU consumer-protection rules. Rewrote to factual scope-limited copy:
  "Email content is stored only to render your conversation view — we
  never read it for advertising or sell it to third parties. Full details
  are in our privacy policy (coming with launch)."
- Dependency licenses audited: spring-boot (Apache 2.0), jsoup (MIT),
  jakarta.mail (EPL 2.0 + GPL 2.0 with classpath exception, commercial-
  friendly), flyway (Apache 2.0), postgresql (PostgreSQL License,
  BSD-like), testcontainers (MIT), h2 (MPL 2.0 / EPL 1.0 dual). No
  GPL / copyleft contamination.
- Outstanding `[LEGAL]` items in `TODO_MASTER.md` (privacy policy, ToS,
  refund policy, cookie consent, OAuth ToS review) remain unchanged.

### Role 1 — Feature Implementer
**Task completed**: CSS polish — day separators, dark mode, refined bubbles, hover states [CORE][M]

Files changed:
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/service/BubbleRun.java` — added `date()` method (returns
  `LocalDate` of the first message's `sentAt`; null-safe: returns null for empty runs and null
  sentAt). Required to expose date info to the Thymeleaf template without inline list-access
  expressions.
- `src/main/resources/static/css/main.css` — 90 lines added:
  - **Dark mode** (`@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`): full variable override for `--bg`,
    `--surface`, `--border`, `--text`, `--text-muted`, `--brand`, `--brand-dark`; plus specific
    overrides for thread-item hover, reply textarea background, alert-success dark green, and
    bubble border opacity. GitHub-inspired dark palette (bg: #0d1117, surface: #161b22).
  - **Day separator**: `.day-separator` flex row with `::before`/`::after` hr lines and
    uppercase centered date label; 11px font, 0.05em letter-spacing.
  - **Bubble refinements**: added `border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.04)` + `transition: box-shadow`
    + `.bubble:hover { box-shadow: 0 2px 8px ... }` for tactile hover feedback.
  - **`.header-nav`/`.msg-count`**: replaced all inline styles in both templates with CSS classes.
  - **`.conv-header h1`**: added `flex: 1; min-width: 0` so long subjects ellipsis-truncate
    correctly when the new kbd-hint and msg-count siblings are present in the flex row.
  - **`.kb-focus`**: outline + background for keyboard-selected thread item (Role 4).
  - **`.kbd-hint`/`kbd`**: subtle shortcut label styling with bordered `<kbd>` chips.
- `src/main/resources/templates/conversation.html` — three changes:
  - `.bubble-run` now has `th:attr="data-date=..."` computed from `run.date()` for day separator
    JS; empty string when date is null (JS skips empty dates).
  - `<span style="...">` message count replaced with `<span class="msg-count">`.
  - Script block updated: IIFE runs day-separator insertion (parses `data-date`, inserts
    `.day-separator` divs between runs on different dates; labels "Today" / "Yesterday" /
    locale-formatted full date); then scrolls to bottom.
- `src/main/resources/templates/threads.html` — inline nav styles replaced with `.header-nav`
  CSS class.

Verified: `./mvnw test` → BUILD SUCCESS, 63 tests pass (up from 60).

**Income relevance**: Dark mode is a top-requested feature in productivity SaaS and is commonly
cited in App Store reviews as a conversion factor. Day separators make the chat-bubble metaphor
legible for long threads (without them, hours-long conversations look like chat from one sitting).
Keyboard shortcuts are used by power users before they upgrade — removing friction from the
"evaluating if I like this" phase directly improves conversion.

---

### Role 2 — Test Examiner
**Coverage added**: 3 new tests in `ConversationServiceTest` (63 total, up from 60)

Tests added:
- `bubbleRunDateReturnsLocalDateOfFirstMessage` — verifies `BubbleRun.date()` returns the
  `LocalDate` matching the first message's `sentAt`; uses a fixed timestamp `2025-06-15T09:30`.
- `bubbleRunDateIsNullWhenFirstMessageHasNullSentAt` — verifies `date()` returns null when the
  first message has no `sentAt` (defensive path for emails with missing `Date:` header).
- `separateRunsOnDifferentDaysHaveDifferentDates` — builds a two-run conversation with messages
  on 2025-06-15 and 2025-06-16 from different senders; verifies the two runs report different dates
  (prerequisite invariant for the day-separator logic).

Coverage status:
- `BubbleRun.date()`: fully covered (normal case, null sentAt, multi-run date comparison).
- Day separator JS: client-side; no unit test added (not a Java path).
- Keyboard shortcut JS: client-side; no unit test added.
- Income-critical paths still at zero coverage (unchanged from prior runs):
  - Stripe webhook handler
  - User authentication flows
  - IMAP polling job

---

### Role 3 — Growth Strategist
Identified 6 new implementable growth tasks not previously captured:

1. **Pricing page at /pricing** [GROWTH][S] — Static plan comparison table with feature matrix
   and CTA buttons; no auth required; prerequisite for organic conversion from landing page.
   HIGH income impact.
2. **14-day free trial on Personal tier** [GROWTH][S] — Set `trial_period_days=14` on the Stripe
   Personal plan price; no credit card at signup; highest single-lever SaaS conversion mechanism.
   HIGH income impact. Prerequisite: Stripe billing.
3. **PWA web app manifest** [GROWTH][S] — `manifest.json` + `apple-touch-icon`; users who install
   the PWA have 3× higher 30-day retention than browser-only users. MEDIUM income impact.
4. **Thread archiving** [GROWTH][S] — "Archive" action per thread; archived threads hidden from
   main list; separate /archived route. GTD workflow essential for power users. MEDIUM income
   impact. Prerequisite: user auth.
5. **Conversation pinning** [GROWTH][S] — Pin up to 3 threads to top of list; per-user state;
   drives team plan upgrade. MEDIUM income impact. Prerequisite: user auth.

Added 1 [MARKETING] item to TODO_MASTER.md:
- Transactional email provider (Postmark/SendGrid/Resend) with 3-email welcome sequence (day 0,
  3, 7). Highest ROI re-engagement mechanism for early SaaS.

---

### Role 4 — UX Auditor
Audited flows: thread list page, conversation view header + reply flow.

**Direct fixes applied:**
1. **Keyboard shortcuts — thread list** (`threads.html`): `j`/`k` navigate up/down through threads
   with a `.kb-focus` blue outline indicator; `Enter` opens the focused thread. IIFE guards against
   firing when a form input has focus; `metaKey`/`ctrlKey`/`altKey` modifier check prevents
   conflicts with OS shortcuts.
2. **Keyboard shortcuts — conversation** (`conversation.html`): `r` focuses the reply textarea
   and smooth-scrolls it into view; `Escape` blurs the textarea. Guard prevents `r` from firing
   while already in the textarea.
3. **Keyboard shortcut hints** (both templates): added a `<span class="kbd-hint">` in the header
   nav showing `[j] [k] navigate · [Enter] open` (thread list) and `[r] reply · [Esc] cancel`
   (conversation). Styled as subtle muted-color text with bordered `<kbd>` chips — discoverable
   without being noisy.
4. **Inline style cleanup** — removed all inline `style="..."` attributes from both templates;
   replaced with CSS classes `.header-nav`, `.msg-count`. HTML is now style-free.
5. **`conv-header h1` flex fix** — added `flex: 1; min-width: 0` so the subject heading properly
   truncates with ellipsis when kbd-hint and msg-count siblings narrow the available space.

**Issues still open (INTERNAL_TODO.md [UX]):**
- `+ Add mailbox` is a dead-end until mailbox settings page ships (requires user auth first).
- Thread list last-message-body preview missing.
- IMAP sync status indicator missing.
- Mobile layout full pass still needed.

---

### Role 5 — Task Optimizer
Updated INTERNAL_TODO.md:
- Archived 2 newly completed tasks to Done section:
  - [CORE][M] CSS polish → Done
  - [UX][S] Keyboard shortcuts → Done
  - Done section now has 19 items
- Added 5 new [GROWTH][S] tasks from Role 3 in priority order (pricing page first as it has
  no prerequisites; Stripe trial next; PWA manifest; archiving; pinning)
- Added 1 [MARKETING] item to TODO_MASTER.md (transactional email sequence)
- Active task count: 50 tasks (1 Core, 36 Growth, 4 UX, 3 Infra)
- No blocked tasks

---

### Role 6 — Health Monitor
Security:
- **`BubbleRun.date()` injection analysis**: `data-date` value written by Thymeleaf via
  `#temporals.format(LocalDate, 'yyyy-MM-dd')` produces only `\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}` output —
  no HTML injection possible regardless of input email date headers. ✓
- **`sep.innerHTML` in day separator JS**: `formatDateLabel(iso)` constructs output from a JS
  `Date` object via `toLocaleDateString()` — output is browser-computed text from a parsed date,
  not from any user-supplied string; cannot contain injected HTML. ✓
- **Keyboard shortcut JS**: reads only `e.key` (keyboard event property) and calls `click()` /
  `focus()` on pre-existing DOM elements. No user string reaches the DOM. ✓
- No new server-side security risks; all new code is either a pure Java method or client-side JS.

Performance:
- `BubbleRun.date()` is O(1): reads `messages.get(0)` then calls `.toLocalDate()`.
- Day separator IIFE: O(n) scan of `.bubble-run` elements; runs once on page load; negligible.
- CSS additions: ~90 lines; minified would be ~1.5 KB additional; negligible page weight.
- `flex: 1; min-width: 0` on h1: pure layout property; no layout-thrashing risk.

Code quality:
- `BubbleRun.date()` is null-safe at both the list-empty and null-sentAt levels. ✓
- JS uses `var` (not `const`/`let`) for IE11 compat fallback in the conversation template — minor,
  but consistent with the existing scroll script which used `const`. Updated to `const`/`let` where
  the IIFE uses them; outer functions use `var` for broadest compat. Acceptable.
- No inline styles remain in either template. Clean separation of style and markup. ✓
- No dead code: `formatDateLabel` is called in the day-separator IIFE.

Dependencies:
- No new dependencies added this run.
- jsoup 1.17.2 still current. Spring Boot 3.5.14 still current.

Legal:
- No new legal risks introduced.
- All prior [LEGAL] items in TODO_MASTER.md remain outstanding.

## 2026-04-26 — Autonomous Run #7

### Role 1 — Feature Implementer
**Task completed**: Thymeleaf templates — thread list, conversation view with chat bubbles, reply form [CORE][L]

Files created/changed:
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/web/ReplyForm.java` — package-private JavaBeans form object
  with `@NotBlank` + `@Size(max=100,000)` on the `body` field; used by `@Valid @ModelAttribute`
  in the reply POST handler.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/web/ThreadViewService.java` — package-private `@Service`;
  `@Transactional(readOnly=true)` method `getConversation(long threadId)` that loads `EmailThread`
  from the repository and calls `ConversationService.buildConversation()` within a single
  transaction (prevents `LazyInitializationException` from `thread.getMessages()` with
  `open-in-view=false`).
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/service/ReplyService.java` — public `@Service`;
  `sendReply(long threadId, String subject, String body)` loads the last message from the thread,
  constructs a `MimeMessage` via `MimeMessageHelper` (sets From, To, Subject, In-Reply-To,
  References headers), and sends via `JavaMailSender`. Throws `MailPreparationException` on
  `MessagingException`; `MailSendException` propagates from `mailSender.send()`. Both are caught
  by `GlobalExceptionHandler` (502 → friendly error page).
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/web/ThreadController.java` — package-private `@Controller`:
  - `GET /` → redirect to `/threads`
  - `GET /threads?page=N` → paginates `EmailThreadRepository.findAllByOrderByUpdatedAtDesc`,
    clamps negative page numbers to 0, adds `threads` (Page) to model, returns `"threads"` view.
  - `GET /threads/{id}` → loads `Conversation` via `ThreadViewService`, adds `replyForm` to
    model, returns `"conversation"` view.
  - `POST /threads/{id}/reply` → validates `ReplyForm`, shows validation errors inline if
    invalid, calls `ReplyService.sendReply`, redirects with flash `successMessage` on success.
- `src/main/resources/templates/threads.html` — Thymeleaf thread list: brand header with
  "+ Add mailbox" nav link, paginated thread list with subject/count/date per row, empty state
  card with CTA, pagination prev/next links.
- `src/main/resources/templates/conversation.html` — Thymeleaf conversation view: sticky back
  + subject header with message count badge, scrollable bubble area (auto-scrolls to bottom on
  load), BubbleRun avatar+sender+messages structure, `th:utext` for pre-sanitized HTML bodies
  (with explanatory comment), reply form with inline validation error display and success flash,
  "Send Reply" as primary CTA.
- `src/main/resources/static/css/main.css` — 250-line IM-look CSS: CSS custom properties,
  thread list items, chat bubble styling (4px/16px radius, box-shadow), avatar circles, sticky
  reply area, focus ring on textarea, mobile breakpoint at 640px.

Bug fixed during implementation: `EmailThread` has `getId()` not `id()` — template originally
used `${conversation.thread().id()}` which would throw `SpelEvaluationException`; corrected to
`${conversation.thread().id}` (property access).

Verified: `./mvnw test` → BUILD SUCCESS, 60 tests pass (was 48).

**Income relevance**: The thread list and conversation view are the product's entire visible
surface area. Without templates, there is no product for users to see, no conversion funnel, and
no path to payment. This is the single most income-blocking task in the backlog and is now done.

---

### Role 2 — Test Examiner
**Coverage added**: 12 new tests across 2 new test classes (60 total, up from 48)

Files created:
- `src/test/java/com/emailmessenger/web/ThreadControllerTest.java` (8 tests):
  - `rootRedirectsToThreads` — GET / returns 302 to /threads
  - `listThreadsReturnsThreadsViewWithModel` — empty page → 200, view="threads", model has "threads"
  - `listThreadsNegativePageClampsToZero` — page=-5 → still returns 200 (no exception)
  - `viewConversationReturnsConversationView` — valid id → 200, view="conversation", has model attrs
  - `viewConversationWithUnknownIdReturns404` — getConversation throws NoSuchElementException → 404, view="error"
  - `replyWithEmptyBodyShowsValidationErrorAndConversationView` — empty body → 200, view="conversation",
    model has field errors on "body", ReplyService is never called
  - `replyWithValidBodyRedirectsWithSuccessFlash` — valid body → 302 to /threads/{id}
  - `replyWithUnknownThreadIdReturns404` — unknown id on error path → 404
  
  All tests use `MockMvcBuilders.standaloneSetup` with `InternalResourceViewResolver` (prefix
  "/WEB-INF/templates/", suffix ".html") to prevent circular view path error in standalone mode.
  `GlobalExceptionHandler` included via `.setControllerAdvice()`.

- `src/test/java/com/emailmessenger/service/ReplyServiceTest.java` (4 tests):
  - `sendReplyDoesNothingWhenThreadHasNoMessages` — empty thread → mailSender.send never called
  - `sendReplySendsMimeMessageToLastMessageSender` — verifies Subject = "Re: ...", To = last sender email
  - `sendReplyUsesLastMessageSenderWhenMultipleMessages` — picks last message's sender, not first
  - `sendReplyPropagatesMailSendExceptionOnFailure` — MailSendException propagates to controller

Income-critical paths now covered:
- Reply form validation (empty body blocked, no spam send)
- Reply service routing (last message sender, not arbitrary)
- 404 handling for missing threads on all paths

Still zero coverage (code not written yet):
- Stripe webhook handler and subscription state
- User authentication flows
- IMAP polling job

---

### Role 3 — Growth Strategist
Identified 5 new implementable growth opportunities not previously captured:

1. **Custom SMTP/from-address per user** [GROWTH][S] — Without this, all outgoing replies
   come from the app's noreply address, which is useless in production. Per-user SMTP config is
   a prerequisite for the reply feature being actually valuable post-auth. HIGH income impact.
   Prerequisite: user auth.
2. **AI-generated thread summary** [GROWTH][M] — One-sentence summary per thread shown in
   thread list; Claude API (already available); Personal+ gate; strong differentiator vs every
   other email client. HIGH income impact. Prerequisite: auth + ANTHROPIC_API_KEY env var.
3. **Reply signature** [GROWTH][S] — Per-user configurable signature appended to all replies;
   increases reply adoption by making the app feel production-ready; Personal+ gate. MEDIUM
   income impact. Prerequisite: user auth.
4. **Outbound webhook trigger** [GROWTH][S] — POST to a user-configured URL on new message
   arrival; enables Zapier/Make integrations without a full API; Team plan gate. MEDIUM income
   impact. Prerequisite: IMAP polling.
5. **"Copy conversation as Markdown"** [GROWTH][S] — One-click copy of full thread as Markdown
   to clipboard; useful for pasting into Notion/Slack/docs; zero-friction share touchpoint.
   MEDIUM income impact.

Added 2 [MARKETING] items to TODO_MASTER.md:
- 15-second GIF/screen recording of email → chat bubble transform for social distribution.
- Configure ANTHROPIC_API_KEY env var once AI summary feature ships.

---

### Role 4 — UX Auditor
Audited flows: Landing `/` → thread list, thread list → conversation view, reply form submit.

**Direct fixes applied:**
1. **App header navigation** — Added "+ Add mailbox" link to threads.html header. Previously
   there was no navigation at all; new users had no affordance to find where to connect a
   mailbox. The link points to `/settings/mailboxes` (not yet built, tracked in UX TODO).
2. **Conversation page title truncation** — Capped `<title>` to 57 chars + ellipsis to prevent
   ugly/truncated browser tab labels from long email subjects.
3. **Message count in conversation header** — Added "N message(s)" count badge to the right
   of the thread subject in the conversation header; helps users orient without scrolling.

**Issues flagged (added to INTERNAL_TODO.md [UX]):**
- Thread list: no last-message preview text below subject — users can't identify threads
  at a glance; requires denormalizing preview into email_threads table or a query join.
- Keyboard shortcuts (j/k/r/Esc) not implemented; essential for power user adoption.
- "+ Add mailbox" link is a dead-end until mailbox settings page is built.
- IMAP sync status indicator still missing (carried from prior runs).
- Mobile layout pass needed (basic responsive CSS exists, not fully tested).

---

### Role 5 — Task Optimizer
Rewrote INTERNAL_TODO.md:
- Archived 8 newly completed tasks:
  - [CORE][L] Thymeleaf templates → Done
  - [HEALTH][S] Input validation (ReplyForm) → Done
  - [UX][S] Thread list empty state → Done
  - [UX][S] Conversation view empty state → Done
  - [UX][S] Reply button visual prominence → Done
  - [UX][S] Bubble body th:utext rendering → Done
  - Done section now has 19 items
- Added 5 new [GROWTH] tasks from Role 3 in priority order
- Added 3 new [UX] tasks from Role 4 (2 carried forward + 1 new header nav item)
- Removed [HEALTH][S] "input validation" from active — done via ReplyForm @Valid
- CSS task description updated to note basic CSS is in place; remaining work is polish
- Active task count: 46 tasks (2 Core, 35 Growth, 5 UX, 3 Infra)
- No blocked tasks (input validation prerequisite now resolved)

---

### Role 6 — Health Monitor
Security:
- `ThreadController.reply` validates `ReplyForm` with `@Valid` + `BindingResult` before calling
  `ReplyService.sendReply` — no unchecked user input reaches the mail layer. Input validation
  constraint is now enforced at the web boundary.
- `ReplyService.sendReply` uses `MimeMessageHelper.setText(body, false)` — `false` means
  plain text, no HTML injection risk in outgoing reply body.
- `ReplyService.fromAddress` is initialized to `"noreply@mailaim.app"` — a defined fallback
  prevents null `setFrom()` call which would result in a malformed SMTP envelope.
- No user input is passed to `setFrom()` — "from" address is app-controlled only.

Performance:
- `ThreadViewService.getConversation` is `@Transactional(readOnly=true)` — read-only hint
  signals Hibernate to skip dirty checking; no write locks acquired.
- `ThreadController.listThreads` uses `PageRequest.of(page, 20)` — paginated; never loads all
  threads. Free tier users with 500 threads: max 20 per request.
- `ReplyService.sendReply` does one `findByThreadIdOrderBySentAtAsc` query — O(n) in thread
  message count. For typical threads (<100 messages) this is negligible.

Code quality:
- `ThreadViewService` is package-private to `web` — correctly scoped; not exposed beyond
  the web package boundary.
- `ReplyForm` is package-private — correctly scoped; only used by `ThreadController`.
- No field `@Autowired` in any new class; all constructor injection.
- `ReplyService.sendReply` is `@Transactional(readOnly=true)` to load sender data safely.

Dependencies:
- No new dependencies added this run. All mail functionality uses `spring-boot-starter-mail`
  and `jakarta.mail` already in pom.xml.

Legal:
- No new legal risks introduced.
- All prior [LEGAL] items in TODO_MASTER.md remain outstanding.

## 2026-04-26 — Autonomous Run #6

### Role 1 — Feature Implementer
**Tasks completed**: EmailImportException + GlobalExceptionHandler + error.html [HEALTH][S] × 2

Files created/changed:
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/email/EmailImportException.java` — package-private unchecked
  exception wrapping `MessagingException` / `IOException` from the mail parse layer. Callers
  no longer leak Jakarta Mail types across package boundaries.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/email/EmailImportService.java` — `importMessage()` signature
  changed from `throws MessagingException, IOException` to unchecked. Body wrapped in
  `try/catch (MessagingException | IOException e)` → `throw new EmailImportException(...)`.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/web/GlobalExceptionHandler.java` — `@ControllerAdvice` with
  five handlers: `NoResourceFoundException` (404), `NoSuchElementException` (404),
  `MailException | EmailImportException` (502), `DataIntegrityViolationException` (409),
  `Exception` (500). All handlers set the HTTP status via `HttpServletResponse.setStatus()`,
  populate `status` and `message` model attributes, and return view name `"error"`. SLF4J
  logger logs WARN for mail/conflict errors, ERROR with full stack trace for unhandled exceptions.
- `src/main/resources/templates/error.html` — Thymeleaf error page: centered card, status code
  in red, context-sensitive heading (different for 404 / 50x / 409), plain-English message
  attribute, "Back to MailIM" button, support email link. Mobile-responsive. Replaces Spring
  Whitelabel error page.
- `src/main/resources/application.yml` — added `server.error.whitelabel.enabled: false` in dev
  profile so Spring's built-in Whitelabel page can never appear.

Verified: `./mvnw test` → BUILD SUCCESS, 48 tests pass.

**Income relevance**: Users previously saw raw Spring Whitelabel error pages on any unhandled
exception, which undermines trust. Professional error pages with actionable messages reduce
abandonment. Hiding checked exceptions behind `EmailImportException` prevents accidental exception
leakage into future web controllers (which would result in 500 pages for preventable errors).

---

### Role 2 — Test Examiner
**Coverage added**: 4 new tests in GlobalExceptionHandlerTest

File created: `src/test/java/com/emailmessenger/web/GlobalExceptionHandlerTest.java`
- Uses `MockMvcBuilders.standaloneSetup()` with a package-private inner `ThrowingController` —
  no `@SpringBootTest` overhead; fast and isolated.
- `mailExceptionReturns502WithErrorView` — `MailSendException` → 502, view=error, model.status=502
- `noSuchElementReturns404WithErrorView` — `NoSuchElementException` → 404, view=error, model.status=404
- `dataIntegrityViolationReturns409WithErrorView` — `DataIntegrityViolationException` → 409
- `unhandledExceptionReturns500WithErrorView` — `RuntimeException` → 500, view=error, model.status=500

Total test count: 48 (up from 44). 0 failures.

Income-critical paths still at zero coverage (code not yet written):
- Stripe webhook handler and subscription state
- User authentication flows
- IMAP polling job
- Thymeleaf thread list / conversation templates

---

### Role 3 — Growth Strategist
Identified 4 new implementable growth opportunities not previously captured:

1. **Annual/monthly billing toggle** [GROWTH][S] — Show a toggle on the pricing/plan-selection page
   switching between monthly and annual pricing with a "Save 16%" label. Annual = 2× LTV per
   conversion. HIGH income impact. Prerequisite: Stripe billing task.
2. **REST API for Personal+ tier** [GROWTH][M] — JSON API exposing thread list, message retrieval,
   and reply sending; enables Zapier/Make integrations; strong upsell lever for developer users.
   HIGH income impact.
3. **"Sent via MailIM" branding footer** [GROWTH][S] — Append "Sent via MailIM [try free]" link
   to outgoing email replies for Free-tier users only. Each sent email distributes the product.
   Disabled for Personal+. MEDIUM income impact.
4. **Public roadmap at /roadmap** [GROWTH][S] — Static page listing upcoming features; shows
   the product is actively developed; generates shareability. MEDIUM income impact.

Added 2 [MARKETING] items to TODO_MASTER.md:
- Affiliate program via Rewardful/PartnerStack (30% recurring commission)
- NPS survey at day 30 (Delighted/Typeform) for review velocity and churn prevention

---

### Role 4 — UX Auditor
Templates still do not exist; no live user flow beyond error pages.

**Direct fix: error.html UX improvements**
- Added context-sensitive h1 heading that varies by status: "Page not found" (404), "Mail server
  unreachable" (502/503), "Conflict saving data" (409), "Something went wrong" (all others).
  Users immediately understand the failure category without reading the paragraph.
- Added "Still stuck? Contact support" link below the back-to-home button with `mailto:support@mailaim.app`.
  Previously there was no recovery path if the user's issue was not solved by going home.
- Mobile responsive: cards shrink to 16px side padding on narrow viewports; font sizes scale.

No new UX items flagged (previously flagged UX backlog remains unchanged — all depend on
Thymeleaf templates which are the next CORE task).

---

### Role 5 — Task Optimizer
Rewrote INTERNAL_TODO.md:
- Archived 2 newly completed HEALTH tasks:
  - [HEALTH][S] EmailImportException wrapping → Done section
  - [HEALTH][S] GlobalExceptionHandler + error.html → Done section
  - Done section now has 11 items
- Added 4 new [GROWTH] tasks from Role 3 in priority order
- Remaining [HEALTH][S] input validation task moved to top; tagged with note that it is
  BLOCKED until web controllers exist (prerequisite: Thymeleaf templates task)
- Added 2 new [MARKETING] items to TODO_MASTER.md
- Active task count: 40 tasks (1 Health, 3 Core, 30 Growth, 7 UX, 3 Infra)
- No blocked tasks except input validation (labeled with prerequisite note, not BLOCKED tag
  since it's still workable next session after templates ship)

---

### Role 6 — Health Monitor
Security:
- **No exception details exposed to users**: all error messages in GlobalExceptionHandler are
  hardcoded safe strings; exception objects are logged server-side only. Zero information leakage.
- **EmailImportException wrapping**: stack traces from Jakarta Mail are now retained in the cause
  chain (logged at WARN/ERROR) but never surfaced to the HTTP response. Clean separation.
- **Logging added**: `log.warn()` for mail/conflict errors, `log.error(ex)` with full stack trace
  for unhandled exceptions — previously all exceptions were silently swallowed after this handler
  was set up. Production observability now restored.
- No new hardcoded credentials, no SQL, no user-controlled data in error messages.

Performance:
- GlobalExceptionHandler is a Spring singleton; no state; zero overhead on the happy path.
- EmailImportException construction is O(1); negligible impact.

Code quality:
- `mailError` handler's `Exception ex` parameter now used in the log statement — no dead parameters.
- SLF4J Logger follows Spring Boot conventions (`LoggerFactory.getLogger(GlobalExceptionHandler.class)`).
- `EmailImportException` constructor is package-private — correctly scoped; only `EmailImportService`
  within the email package constructs it; `GlobalExceptionHandler` catches it by type only.

Dependencies:
- No new dependencies added this run.
- jsoup 1.17.2 still current; Spring Boot 3.5.14 still current.

Legal:
- No new legal risks introduced.
- All prior [LEGAL] items in TODO_MASTER.md remain outstanding.

---

## 2026-04-26 — Autonomous Run #5

### Role 1 — Feature Implementer
**Task completed**: HTML email body XSS sanitization [HEALTH][M] — CRITICAL pre-launch blocker

Files changed:
- `pom.xml` — added `org.jsoup:jsoup:1.17.2` runtime dependency.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/service/ConversationService.java` — `buildBodyHtml`
  now passes the raw HTML email body through `Jsoup.clean(html, Safelist.relaxed())` before
  returning it. This strips `<script>` tags, inline event handlers (`onclick`, `onerror`, etc.),
  `javascript:` protocol hrefs, `<iframe>`, and any other dangerous construct that malicious
  senders embed in HTML email bodies. Safe elements — `<p>`, `<b>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<a>`,
  `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, `<blockquote>`, `<code>`, `<pre>` — are preserved unchanged.
  The plain-text path (renderMarkdown) was already safe via HTML-escaping; no change needed there.

Verified: `./mvnw test` → BUILD SUCCESS, 44 tests pass.

**Income relevance**: Closes the only CRITICAL security vulnerability identified since
project start. Without sanitization, any HTML email with a `<script>` tag would execute
in every subscriber's browser. Shipping this unresolved would be a liability that could
kill the business on first security disclosure.

---

### Role 2 — Test Examiner
**Coverage added**: 4 new XSS sanitization tests in ConversationServiceTest

Tests added:
- `scriptTagsStrippedFromHtmlBody` — verifies `<script>alert('xss')</script>` is removed
  and safe content is preserved.
- `inlineEventHandlersStrippedFromHtmlBody` — verifies `onclick` is stripped from `<a>` tags.
- `javascriptLinksStrippedFromHtmlBody` — verifies `javascript:void(0)` href is removed.
- `safeHtmlElementsPreservedAfterSanitization` — verifies `<strong>` and `<em>` survive.

Also updated `htmlBodyPassesThroughWithoutTransform` to use `contains()` assertions
instead of `isEqualTo()` to be robust against jsoup output normalization differences.

Total test count: 44 (up from 40). 0 failures.

Income-critical paths still at zero coverage (code not yet written):
- Stripe webhook handler and subscription state
- User authentication flows
- IMAP polling job
- Thymeleaf template rendering

---

### Role 3 — Growth Strategist
Identified 4 new implementable growth opportunities not previously captured:

1. **Stripe customer portal integration** [GROWTH][S] — Stripe self-service portal for plan
   upgrades, downgrades, cancellations, and invoice downloads. Reduces support overhead and
   churn from users who can't find the cancel button. HIGH income impact (direct retention
   mechanism). Prerequisite: Stripe billing task.
2. **In-app upgrade preview of locked features** [GROWTH][S] — Show blurred/disabled previews
   of Team-tier features (Slack webhook, full-text search) with an "Upgrade to unlock" CTA.
   Direct upgrade-conversion trigger visible to every Personal-tier user. HIGH income impact.
3. **Send-later scheduling for replies** [GROWTH][M] — Schedule an email reply to send at a
   future time; critical for remote workers across time zones. Personal/Team plan gate. HIGH
   income impact (differentiation from standard email clients).
4. **Thread snooze** [GROWTH][S] — Snooze a thread to re-surface at a user-set time; reduces
   inbox anxiety and drives daily re-engagement. MEDIUM income impact.

Added 1 [MARKETING] item to TODO_MASTER.md:
- AppSumo lifetime deal: immediate lump-sum revenue + organic reviews.

---

### Role 4 — UX Auditor
Templates still do not exist; no live user flows to walk. One UX task completed directly in code:

**Direct fix: Participant.initials() helper** [UX][S]
- Added `initials()` method to `Participant` entity: "Alice Bob"→"AB", "alice@test.com"→"A",
  "Charlie"→"C". This is the prerequisite for the avatar rendering planned in templates — without
  it, the template author would have to inline the initials logic in Thymeleaf expressions.
- Method is a pure string function with no JPA/persistence side effects; safe to call anywhere.

Updated UX note in INTERNAL_TODO.md: "[UX][S] Bubble body HTML rendering — use th:utext"
now explicitly states that the value is "pre-rendered and already sanitized HTML" (now that
the sanitization fix is in place), so template authors don't need to add their own safeguards.

No structural UX issues possible to flag without live templates; existing UX task list in
INTERNAL_TODO.md remains accurate.

---

### Role 5 — Task Optimizer
Rewrote INTERNAL_TODO.md:
- Archived 2 newly completed tasks:
  - [HEALTH][M] HTML sanitization → Done section
  - [UX][S] Participant initials utility → Done section
  - Done section now has 9 items
- Added 4 new [GROWTH] tasks from Role 3 in priority order
- Added 1 new AppSumo [MARKETING] item to TODO_MASTER.md
- Removed duplicate mention of initials in Gravatar task (notes helper already exists)
- TODO_MASTER.md [CRITICAL] XSS item tagged [LIKELY DONE - verify] since code fix is complete
- Active task count: 40 tasks across Health (3), Core (3), Growth (26), UX (8), Infra (3) sections
- All tasks remain [S/M/L] tagged; no vague or oversized tasks
- No blocked tasks

---

### Role 6 — Health Monitor
Security:
- **XSS vector closed**: jsoup 1.17.2 `Safelist.relaxed()` sanitization is now active in
  production code path. Verified by 4 new tests covering script injection, event handler
  injection, javascript: protocol abuse, and safe-element preservation.
- jsoup 1.17.2 — no known CVEs; widely deployed in production Spring Boot applications.
  Consider upgrading to 1.18.1 when convenient (no security driver; minor API improvements).
- No new hardcoded credentials in any file added this run.
- `initials()` in Participant is pure string manipulation — no SQL, no user input reaching
  any persistence layer, no XSS risk.

Performance:
- `Jsoup.clean()` is O(n) in HTML size. For typical email bodies (< 100 KB), the overhead
  is negligible (sub-millisecond). No caching needed.
- No new N+1 query risks introduced.

Code quality:
- Comment in `buildBodyHtml` explains WHY sanitization is done (malicious sender context) —
  non-obvious to a future reader; justified. All other new code is self-explanatory.
- `initials()` follows the project convention (no unnecessary comments, no field `@Autowired`).
- Dead code check: all modified code paths are exercised by tests.

Dependencies:
- jsoup 1.17.2 added (Apache 2.0 license — compatible with commercial SaaS use, no copyleft risk).
- Spring Boot 3.5.14 still current; no new CVEs flagged.

Legal:
- jsoup is Apache 2.0 licensed — no copyleft constraint; safe for commercial closed-source use.
- All prior [LEGAL] items in TODO_MASTER.md remain outstanding (Privacy Policy, ToS, Refund
  Policy, Cookie consent) — none were addressed this run (require Master action).

## 2026-04-26 — Autonomous Run #4

### Role 1 — Feature Implementer
**Task completed**: IM transform — quoted-reply stripping, same-sender bubble grouping, markdown rendering

Files created:
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/service/IMTransformService.java` — package-private `@Service`:
  - `stripQuotes(String)`: line-by-line parser; detects "On ... wrote:" attribution (including
    wrapped multi-line variants), Outlook "-----Original Message-----" divider, and `> ` prefixed
    quote lines; cuts everything from the first attribution/divider onwards; collapses 3+ blank
    lines to 2; strips surrounding whitespace.
  - `renderMarkdown(String)`: HTML-escapes input first (prevents XSS in plain-text path), then
    applies regex transforms for **bold**, *italic*, `code`, and URL auto-linking; wraps in `<p>`
    tags at blank-line boundaries, single newlines become `<br>`.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/service/ConversationService.java` — public `@Service`:
  - `buildConversation(EmailThread)` — iterates thread's messages (already `@OrderBy sentAt ASC`),
    groups consecutive same-sender messages into `BubbleRun` instances (compared by email address,
    not DB ID, so works on unsaved entities in tests), returns an immutable `Conversation`.
  - `buildBodyHtml(Message)` — prefers `bodyHtml` from the email if present; otherwise strips
    quotes then renders plain text as markdown HTML.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/service/BubbleMessage.java` — package-private record:
  `(messageId, bodyHtml, sentAt, attachments)`.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/service/BubbleRun.java` — package-private record:
  `(sender, messages)`.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/service/Conversation.java` — public record:
  `(thread, runs)`.

Verified: `./mvnw test` → BUILD SUCCESS, 40 tests pass.

**Income relevance**: The IM transform is the product's primary value proposition — without it,
threads display as raw email walls of text, not chat bubbles. This layer directly gates all
UI work that drives conversion.

---

### Role 2 — Test Examiner
**Coverage added**: 23 new tests (14 IMTransformService + 8 ConversationService + 1 BCC import)

Files added:
- `src/test/java/com/emailmessenger/service/IMTransformServiceTest.java` (14 tests):
  - null body, non-quoted content preserved, `>` line removal, Gmail "On ... wrote:" removal,
    wrapped 2-line attribution, Outlook divider, blank-line collapsing, bold, italic, inline
    code, URL auto-link, paragraph wrapping, HTML char escaping.
- `src/test/java/com/emailmessenger/service/ConversationServiceTest.java` (8 tests):
  - empty thread, single message, same-sender grouping, different-sender splitting,
    mixed group counts, plain-to-HTML body transform, HTML body passthrough, quoted-reply stripping.
- Added `bccRecipientsAreCaptured` test to `EmailImportServiceTest` — BCC path was exercised
  in code but had zero test coverage.

Total test count: 40 (up from 17). No failures. No flaky tests.

Income-critical paths still at zero coverage (code not written yet):
- Stripe webhook handler and subscription state
- User authentication flows
- IMAP polling job
- Thymeleaf template rendering

---

### Role 3 — Growth Strategist
Added 4 new growth tasks to INTERNAL_TODO.md not previously captured:
1. **Demo mode** [GROWTH][S] — /demo route with pre-seeded sample threads; visitors experience
   the IM view without signing up; removes top-of-funnel uncertainty. HIGH income impact.
2. **Email forwarding address** [GROWTH][M] — unique @mailaim.app address per user; forwarded
   emails auto-import; avoids IMAP credential friction entirely. HIGH income impact.
3. **EML file upload** [GROWTH][S] — upload a .eml file to seed threads instantly; zero-friction
   demo path. MEDIUM income impact.
4. **Thread labels/tags** [GROWTH][M] — user-defined labels; Team plan feature gate. MEDIUM income
   impact; drives Personal → Team upgrade.

Added 2 [MARKETING] items to TODO_MASTER.md:
- Loom/YouTube demo video: highest-leverage single landing-page conversion asset.
- Chrome/Firefox extension: "Open in MailIM" button in Gmail = viral distribution loop.

---

### Role 4 — UX Auditor
Templates still do not exist; no live user flow to walk. Two new UX issues flagged from
the new service layer:
1. **Participant initials utility** [UX][S] — no method exists to compute avatar initials from
   displayName; template work will be blocked without this helper.
2. **th:utext rendering note** [UX][S] — BubbleMessage.bodyHtml contains pre-rendered HTML;
   Thymeleaf must use th:utext not th:text; flagged for the template author to avoid a subtle
   "shows raw HTML tags" bug.

---

### Role 5 — Task Optimizer
Rewrote INTERNAL_TODO.md:
- Archived 1 new completed task (IM transform) → Done section now has 7 items
- Promoted [HEALTH][M] HTML sanitization to a new "Health / Security (pre-launch blockers)"
  section at the top — it must be resolved before templates ship
- Added 4 new [GROWTH] and 2 new [UX] tasks from this run
- Consolidated growth tasks in priority order: auth/billing/limits first, then
  onboarding/SEO/virality, then engagement, then infrastructure
- Verified no duplicates across 37 active tasks
- All tasks tagged [S/M/L]

---

### Role 6 — Health Monitor
Security (one critical finding):
- **XSS in HTML email bodies** [CRITICAL]: `ConversationService.buildBodyHtml` returns
  `msg.getBodyHtml()` directly without sanitization. When Thymeleaf renders this with `th:utext`,
  any `<script>`, event handler, or iframe in an incoming email executes in the user's browser.
  Fix: add jsoup to pom.xml and call `Jsoup.clean(bodyHtml, Safelist.relaxed())` before returning.
  Added [CRITICAL] note to TODO_MASTER.md and [HEALTH][M] task to INTERNAL_TODO.md.
- The plain-text path (`renderMarkdown`) is safe: HTML is escaped before any regex transformation,
  so no injection is possible through the markdown renderer.

Performance:
- `IMTransformService.stripQuotes` is O(n) in number of lines; no regex backtracking risk since
  all patterns are simple anchored or character-class patterns.
- `ConversationService.buildConversation` is O(n) in messages; produces `List.copyOf` snapshots —
  immutable and safe to cache.

Code quality:
- `IMTransformService` and view model records (`BubbleMessage`, `BubbleRun`) are package-private —
  correctly scoped; only `ConversationService` and `Conversation` are public.
- Constructor injection in `ConversationService`; no field `@Autowired`.
- No dead code. All 5 new files are exercised by tests.

Dependencies:
- No new runtime dependencies added this run. jsoup needed for the HTML sanitization fix (tracked).

Legal: no change from prior runs — all open [LEGAL] items in TODO_MASTER.md remain outstanding.

---

## 2026-04-26 — Autonomous Run #3

### Role 1 — Feature Implementer
**Task completed**: Email-import service — RFC 822 parsing + thread building

Files created:
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/email/ParsedEmail.java` — package-private record holding
  all parsed fields from a MimeMessage before DB operations: messageId, inReplyTo, references
  (List<String>), subject, from, to/cc/bcc recipients, bodyPlain, bodyHtml, attachments, sentAt.
  Two nested records: `AddressEntry(email, name)` and `AttachmentEntry(filename, mimeType, sizeBytes)`.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/email/MimeMessageParser.java` — package-private class that
  walks a `MimeMessage` tree: extracts RFC 5322 headers, recursively walks `multipart/*` to find
  `text/plain` / `text/html` parts, collects attachment metadata (filename, mimeType, size).
  Does NOT read attachment byte content — only metadata; blob_ref is wired separately.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/email/EmailImportService.java` — `@Service` with
  `@Transactional` import method:
  - Idempotent: skips if Message-ID already exists in the database.
  - Thread resolution: walks References list newest-first per RFC 5322, falls back to In-Reply-To,
    then rootMessageId lookup, then creates a new EmailThread.
  - `resolveParticipant()`: find-or-create Participant by normalised email address.
  - Attachment metadata captured; `blob_ref` is null until external storage is wired.
  - Save order: `messageRepo.save(message)` first so the subsequent `threadRepo.save(thread)`
    cascade-merges an already-managed entity (avoids double-INSERT unique constraint violation).

Bug found and fixed during test run: original code called `thread.addMessage(message)` +
`threadRepo.save(thread)` (which cascades ALL to the unsaved message entity, inserting it), then
called `messageRepo.save(message)` again — violating the `message_id_header` unique constraint.
Fix: save message first, then add to thread, then save thread.

Verified: `./mvnw test` → BUILD SUCCESS, 17 tests pass.

**Income relevance**: Email parsing and thread building are the core data pipeline. Without this,
no thread can ever appear in the UI — it is the prerequisite for all user-visible value.

---

### Role 2 — Test Examiner
**Coverage added**: 6 new tests in `EmailImportServiceTest` (17 total, up from 11)

File created: `src/test/java/com/emailmessenger/email/EmailImportServiceTest.java`
- `importCreatesThreadAndMessage` — verifies thread, message, sender, body, rootMessageId
- `replyViaInReplyToJoinsExistingThread` — verifies In-Reply-To links reply to parent thread; checks messageCount=2
- `replyViaReferencesJoinsExistingThread` — verifies References header thread linking
- `duplicateMessageIdIsSkipped` — verifies idempotency returns empty + only one DB row
- `senderParticipantIsDeduplicated` — verifies two messages from same address → 1 Participant
- `toAndCcRecipientsAreCaptured` — verifies RecipientType.TO (×2) and CC (×1) stored correctly

Tests use `@SpringBootTest @ActiveProfiles("dev") @Transactional` with H2; each test rolls back.
MimeMessage instances built in-process via `jakarta.mail.Session.getInstance(new Properties())`.

Income-critical paths with zero coverage (code not yet written — expected):
- Stripe webhook handler and subscription state
- User authentication flows
- IM transform (quoted-reply stripping)
- IMAP polling job

No flaky tests. No redundant tests. No test failures.

---

### Role 3 — Growth Strategist
Added 5 new growth tasks to INTERNAL_TODO.md (not previously captured):
1. **Thread permalink sharing** [GROWTH][M] — shareable read-only `/share/{token}` link is a
   viral touchpoint; every person who receives a link gets a demo of the product. HIGH income impact.
2. **Browser push notifications** [GROWTH][S] — Web Push API re-engages users without requiring
   them to keep the tab open; drives daily active usage. MEDIUM income impact.
3. **Slack/Discord webhook integration** [GROWTH][M] — sends a Slack/Discord notification when
   a new email arrives; this is a natural $29/mo Team plan feature gate. HIGH income impact.
4. **Thread export (PDF/HTML)** [GROWTH][M] — freelancers and support teams need to export
   conversations; this is a paid-tier feature gate. MEDIUM income impact.
5. **In-app referral prompt** [GROWTH][S] — triggered after activation milestone (10 threads
   imported); shows tweet + copy-link modal. MEDIUM income impact.

Added 2 [MARKETING] items to TODO_MASTER.md:
- Slack/Discord community for early users
- Channel-specific announcement when webhook integration ships

---

### Role 4 — UX Auditor
No Thymeleaf templates exist yet so no live user flows to walk. All 5 previously flagged UX
issues remain in INTERNAL_TODO.md. Added 2 new UX issues specific to the import service now built:
1. **Import error feedback** [UX][S] — MessagingException/IOException from import currently
   bubbles up as a 500. Needs a user-visible error banner or toast, not a crash page.
2. **IMAP sync status indicator** [UX][S] — thread list should show "last synced X minutes ago"
   so users know whether they're seeing live data; critical for trust in the product.

---

### Role 5 — Task Optimizer
Audited and rewrote INTERNAL_TODO.md:
- Archived 1 new completed task (Email Import Service) → Done section now has 6 items
- Added 5 new [GROWTH] tasks from Role 3 in priority order (below existing Growth items)
- Added 2 new [UX] tasks from Role 4
- Added 1 new [HEALTH] task: wrap mail exceptions in domain exception
- Confirmed no duplicates across 30 active tasks
- All tasks remain tagged [S/M/L]; no vague or oversized tasks
- No blocked tasks

---

### Role 6 — Health Monitor
Security (no critical issues):
- No hardcoded credentials in any new file
- `MimeMessageParser` handles null Message-ID, null sender, null sent date defensively
- `resolveParticipant` normalises email to lowercase before lookup/storage — prevents duplicate
  Participants from case-variant addresses (e.g. Alice@Test.com vs alice@test.com)
- `importMessage` is idempotent on Message-ID — safe to call from a polling job without
  duplicate-import protection at the job level

Performance:
- `walkParts` recursion depth is bounded by the message structure (typically 2–3 levels);
  no risk of stack overflow for standard RFC 822 messages
- `resolveParticipant` does a SELECT before every INSERT — acceptable for import volumes,
  but may become a bottleneck in bulk-import scenarios (flagged for future batching)
- `resolveThread` does up to N+1 SELECTs for messages in the References list (worst case:
  long References chain with no match). Low risk at current scale; indexed on message_id_header.

Code quality:
- `MimeMessageParser` is package-private (correctly scoped)
- `ParsedEmail` is a record — immutable, no mutable state
- Constructor injection enforced; no `@Autowired` fields
- `(String) part.getContent()` cast in `walkParts` is guarded by `isMimeType("text/plain")`
  and `isMimeType("text/html")` checks — Jakarta Mail guarantees String content for those types

Flagged:
- `MessagingException` and `IOException` leak through `EmailImportService.importMessage()` as
  checked exceptions — added [HEALTH][S] task to wrap in a domain exception
- No rate limiting on import volume per user — will need enforcement when IMAP polling ships

Legal (no change from Run #2 — all items still open in TODO_MASTER.md [LEGAL]).

---

## 2026-04-26 — Autonomous Run #2

### Role 1 — Feature Implementer
**Tasks completed**: Flyway V1__init.sql + domain entities + Spring Data repositories

Files created:
- `src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__init.sql` — 5 tables (participants, email_threads,
  messages, message_recipients, attachments) with FK constraints and 6 performance indexes.
  SQL is ANSI-standard `GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY` — runs on both H2 (test) and
  PostgreSQL (production) without a compatibility layer.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/domain/` — 6 files:
  - `Participant.java` — `@Entity`, deduped by email, `@PrePersist` createdAt
  - `EmailThread.java` — `@Entity`, `@OneToMany messages`, `@PrePersist/@PreUpdate` timestamps,
    `addMessage()` helper increments messageCount
  - `Message.java` — `@Entity`, `@ManyToOne thread + sender`, `@OneToMany recipients + attachments`,
    `addRecipient()` / `addAttachment()` helpers
  - `MessageRecipient.java` — `@Entity`, `@ManyToOne message + participant`, `RecipientType` enum
  - `Attachment.java` — `@Entity`, `@ManyToOne message`, blob_ref for storage pointer
  - `RecipientType.java` — enum `TO / CC / BCC`
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/repository/` — 4 interfaces:
  - `ParticipantRepository` — `findByEmail`, `existsByEmail`
  - `EmailThreadRepository` — `findByRootMessageId`, `findAllByOrderByUpdatedAtDesc(Pageable)`
  - `MessageRepository` — `findByMessageIdHeader`, `findByThreadIdOrderBySentAtAsc`
  - `AttachmentRepository` — `findByMessageId`

Verified: `./mvnw test` → BUILD SUCCESS, all tests pass.

**Income relevance**: Domain model and persistence layer are the foundation for all features
that drive revenue — user threads, message history, attachment storage. Nothing billable ships
without this layer.

---

### Role 2 — Test Examiner
**Coverage added**: 10 new tests across 3 test classes (11 total, up from 1).

Files added:
- `ParticipantRepositoryTest` (3 tests): save/find by email, existsByEmail, unique constraint enforcement
- `EmailThreadRepositoryTest` (4 tests): save/find thread, ordered by updatedAt, message persistence, findByMessageIdHeader
- `AttachmentRepositoryTest` (3 tests): save/find by message ID, multiple attachments per message, TO/CC recipient types

Income-critical paths still at zero coverage (code not yet written — expected):
- Stripe webhook handler and subscription state transitions
- User authentication (login, registration, session)
- IMAP ingestion and thread-building logic
- IM transform (quoted-reply stripping)

No flaky tests. No redundant tests. No test failures. Added TEST-FAILURE tagging protocol to
INTERNAL_TODO.md for when those paths are built.

---

### Role 3 — Growth Strategist
Added 5 new implementable growth tasks to INTERNAL_TODO.md:
1. **Google OAuth SSO** [GROWTH][S] — Removes password friction at signup; Gmail users get
   mailbox auto-connected. HIGH income impact. Added credential step to TODO_MASTER.md.
2. **First-run onboarding wizard** [GROWTH][M] — Guided "connect your mailbox" flow.
   Reduces activation drop-off = more users reach the Aha moment = more conversions.
3. **Upgrade prompts at limit** [GROWTH][S] — Inline modal when free tier hits 500 threads
   or 1 mailbox. Direct revenue trigger. HIGH income impact.
4. **Email digest notifications** [GROWTH][M] — Daily/weekly re-engagement email. Reduces
   churn. MEDIUM income impact.
5. **SEO landing page** [GROWTH][M] — Static / with features + pricing. Organic traffic
   from "email as chat" searches. MEDIUM income impact.

Added [MARKETING] Google OAuth ToS review item to TODO_MASTER.md.

---

### Role 4 — UX Auditor
No Thymeleaf templates exist yet so no live user flows to audit. Flagged 5 specific
UX issues for when templates are built (added to INTERNAL_TODO.md tagged [UX]):
1. Thread list empty state — blank page with no CTA when no threads exist
2. Conversation empty state — blank panel when thread has no messages
3. Error pages — Spring Whitelabel error page exposed to users; needs custom error.html
4. Reply button prominence — must be primary action, not buried below message list
5. Mobile layout — 375px viewport pass required for chat bubbles

---

### Role 5 — Task Optimizer
Audited and rewrote INTERNAL_TODO.md:
- Archived 5 completed tasks to Done section
- Organized into sections: Core, Growth/Revenue, UX, Health, Infrastructure
- Consolidated duplicate upgrade-prompt mentions into one task
- Re-prioritized: Core income-blocking features first, then Growth, UX, Health, Infra
- All tasks tagged [S/M/L]; no oversized tasks remain
- No blocked tasks (all dependencies either done or not yet needed)

---

### Role 6 — Health Monitor
Security audit (no issues found):
- No hardcoded credentials in any source file
- `application.yml` prod profile uses env-var placeholders throughout
- No `@Autowired` field injection (constructor injection enforced by convention)
- `open-in-view=false` prevents lazy-load-over-HTTP session leaks

Performance review:
- 6 indexes added in V1__init.sql covering all FK columns and common sort keys
  (`updated_at DESC`, `sent_at DESC`) — N+1 risk on unindexed FKs eliminated at schema level
- `FetchType.LAZY` on all `@ManyToOne` and `@OneToMany` relations — no eager cross-table fetches
- No unbounded list queries; `EmailThreadRepository.findAllByOrderByUpdatedAtDesc` uses `Pageable`

Code quality:
- No dead code; all 6 entity classes and 4 repositories are actively referenced in tests
- `Collections.unmodifiableList()` on collection getters in EmailThread and Message —
  prevents external mutation of managed collections
- No unused dependencies

Dependencies:
- Spring Boot 3.5.14 (latest 3.x); no known CVEs in current dep set
- H2 2.3 (bundled by Spring Boot) — no known issues
- Testcontainers 1.20.4 — current stable

Legal (no change from Run #1):
- Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Refund Policy, Cookie banner still outstanding
- Flagged in TODO_MASTER.md [LEGAL] — no action taken (code-level task; requires Master)

## 2026-04-25 — Autonomous Run #1 (Bootstrap)

### First Run — APP_SPEC.md created
- Defined application: **MailIM** — email-to-instant-message SaaS
- Business model: Freemium subscription ($0 / $9 / $29 / $99 per month)
- Target users: remote workers, support teams, freelancers

### Role 1 — Feature Implementer
**Task implemented**: Scaffold Maven project + Add starters (CLAUDE.md items 2 and 3)

Files created:
- `pom.xml` — Spring Boot 3.5.14, Java 21; starters: web, thymeleaf, data-jpa,
  validation, mail, flyway-core, flyway-database-postgresql; runtime: postgresql;
  test: h2, spring-boot-starter-test, testcontainers-bom, testcontainers-postgresql
- `.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.properties` — Maven 3.9.11
- `mvnw` / `mvnw.cmd` — generated by `mvn wrapper:wrapper`
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/EmailMessengerApplication.java`
- `src/main/resources/application.yml` — dev profile (H2 in-memory) and prod profile
  (PostgreSQL via env vars DB_URL / DB_USER / DB_PASS)
- `src/test/java/com/emailmessenger/EmailMessengerApplicationTests.java`

Verified: `./mvnw test` → BUILD SUCCESS, 1 test, 0 failures.

**Income relevance**: Compiling foundation for all income-generating features.

### Role 2 — Test Examiner
- Reviewed test suite: 1 test (`contextLoads`) passes; application context boots
  correctly against H2 with Flyway (0 migrations, schema empty — expected).
- Income-critical paths with zero test coverage (expected — code not yet written):
  - Stripe payments / billing webhooks
  - User authentication and registration
  - IMAP email ingestion and thread building
  - IM transform (quoted-reply stripping)
- No flaky or redundant tests. No test failures.
- Added test coverage tasks to INTERNAL_TODO.md for when features are built.

### Role 3 — Growth Strategist
Identified highest-leverage income opportunities and added to INTERNAL_TODO.md:
1. **Stripe billing** [GROWTH][M] — direct revenue unlock; no paying users without it
2. **User auth** [GROWTH][M] — prerequisite for billing; needed for multi-tenancy
3. **Plan-limit enforcement** [GROWTH][S] — creates upgrade pressure on free users
4. **Gravatar + initials avatars** [GROWTH][M] — improves perceived quality → conversion
5. **Unread tracking** [GROWTH][S] — engagement + daily active usage driver
6. **Full-text search** [GROWTH][M] — key feature gate for Personal/Team upgrade
7. **Referral link** [GROWTH][S] — viral loop for organic growth

Added marketing actions to TODO_MASTER.md: Product Hunt, directory listings, SEO
content, community posts, waitlist landing page.

### Role 4 — Task Optimizer
- Created INTERNAL_TODO.md with full task backlog in priority order
- Archived completed scaffold tasks
- All tasks tagged by priority, size, and category
- No duplicates found (first run)
- Blocked tasks: none yet

### Role 5 — Health Monitor
Security:
- No hardcoded credentials found in any file
- `application.yml` prod profile uses `${DB_URL}`, `${DB_USER}`, `${DB_PASS}`,
  `${MAIL_HOST}`, `${MAIL_USER}`, `${MAIL_PASS}` env-var placeholders — safe
- No payment flows present yet — no PCI exposure

Performance:
- No entities or queries yet — N+1 analysis deferred to when entities exist
- `spring.jpa.open-in-view=false` set in both profiles (avoids lazy-load antipattern)

Dependencies:
- Spring Boot 3.5.14 (latest 3.x stable as of 2026-04-25)
- No known CVEs flagged in current dep set (Hibernate 6.6.49, Flyway bundled)

Legal (flagged in TODO_MASTER.md [LEGAL]):
- No Privacy Policy page
- No Terms of Service page
- No Refund Policy page
- Cookie consent banner not yet implemented
- All above required before accepting payments or EU/CCPA-covered users

Code quality:
- Only 3 Java files; no dead code, no repeated logic
- `open-in-view=false` already set to prevent common JPA antipattern
