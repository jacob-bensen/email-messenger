# Changelog

## 2026-04-26 — Autonomous Run #6

### Role 1 — Feature Implementer
**Tasks completed**: EmailImportException + GlobalExceptionHandler + error.html [HEALTH][S] × 2

Files created/changed:
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/email/EmailImportException.java` — package-private unchecked
  exception wrapping `MessagingException` / `IOException` from the mail parse layer. Callers
  no longer leak Jakarta Mail types across package boundaries.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/email/EmailImportService.java` — `importMessage()` signature
  changed from `throws MessagingException, IOException` to unchecked. Body wrapped in
  `try/catch (MessagingException | IOException e)` → `throw new EmailImportException(...)`.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/web/GlobalExceptionHandler.java` — `@ControllerAdvice` with
  five handlers: `NoResourceFoundException` (404), `NoSuchElementException` (404),
  `MailException | EmailImportException` (502), `DataIntegrityViolationException` (409),
  `Exception` (500). All handlers set the HTTP status via `HttpServletResponse.setStatus()`,
  populate `status` and `message` model attributes, and return view name `"error"`. SLF4J
  logger logs WARN for mail/conflict errors, ERROR with full stack trace for unhandled exceptions.
- `src/main/resources/templates/error.html` — Thymeleaf error page: centered card, status code
  in red, context-sensitive heading (different for 404 / 50x / 409), plain-English message
  attribute, "Back to MailIM" button, support email link. Mobile-responsive. Replaces Spring
  Whitelabel error page.
- `src/main/resources/application.yml` — added `server.error.whitelabel.enabled: false` in dev
  profile so Spring's built-in Whitelabel page can never appear.

Verified: `./mvnw test` → BUILD SUCCESS, 48 tests pass.

**Income relevance**: Users previously saw raw Spring Whitelabel error pages on any unhandled
exception, which undermines trust. Professional error pages with actionable messages reduce
abandonment. Hiding checked exceptions behind `EmailImportException` prevents accidental exception
leakage into future web controllers (which would result in 500 pages for preventable errors).

### Role 2 — Test Examiner
**Coverage added**: 4 new tests in GlobalExceptionHandlerTest

File created: `src/test/java/com/emailmessenger/web/GlobalExceptionHandlerTest.java`
- Uses `MockMvcBuilders.standaloneSetup()` with a package-private inner `ThrowingController` —
  no `@SpringBootTest` overhead; fast and isolated.
- `mailExceptionReturns502WithErrorView` — `MailSendException` → 502, view=error, model.status=502
- `noSuchElementReturns404WithErrorView` — `NoSuchElementException` → 404, view=error, model.status=404
- `dataIntegrityViolationReturns409WithErrorView` — `DataIntegrityViolationException` → 409
- `unhandledExceptionReturns500WithErrorView` — `RuntimeException` → 500, view=error, model.status=500

Total test count: 48 (up from 44). 0 failures.

Income-critical paths still at zero coverage (code not yet written):
- Stripe webhook handler and subscription state
- User authentication flows
- IMAP polling job
- Thymeleaf thread list / conversation templates

---

### Role 3 — Growth Strategist
Identified 4 new implementable growth opportunities not previously captured:

1. **Annual/monthly billing toggle** [GROWTH][S] — Show a toggle on the pricing/plan-selection page
   switching between monthly and annual pricing with a "Save 16%" label. Annual = 2× LTV per
   conversion. HIGH income impact. Prerequisite: Stripe billing task.
2. **REST API for Personal+ tier** [GROWTH][M] — JSON API exposing thread list, message retrieval,
   and reply sending; enables Zapier/Make integrations; strong upsell lever for developer users.
   HIGH income impact.
3. **"Sent via MailIM" branding footer** [GROWTH][S] — Append "Sent via MailIM [try free]" link
   to outgoing email replies for Free-tier users only. Each sent email distributes the product.
   Disabled for Personal+. MEDIUM income impact.
4. **Public roadmap at /roadmap** [GROWTH][S] — Static page listing upcoming features; shows
   the product is actively developed; generates shareability. MEDIUM income impact.

Added 2 [MARKETING] items to TODO_MASTER.md:
- Affiliate program via Rewardful/PartnerStack (30% recurring commission)
- NPS survey at day 30 (Delighted/Typeform) for review velocity and churn prevention

---

### Role 4 — UX Auditor
Templates still do not exist; no live user flow beyond error pages.

**Direct fix: error.html UX improvements**
- Added context-sensitive h1 heading that varies by status: "Page not found" (404), "Mail server
  unreachable" (502/503), "Conflict saving data" (409), "Something went wrong" (all others).
  Users immediately understand the failure category without reading the paragraph.
- Added "Still stuck? Contact support" link below the back-to-home button with `mailto:support@mailaim.app`.
  Previously there was no recovery path if the user's issue was not solved by going home.
- Mobile responsive: cards shrink to 16px side padding on narrow viewports; font sizes scale.

No new UX items flagged (previously flagged UX backlog remains unchanged — all depend on
Thymeleaf templates which are the next CORE task).

---

### Role 5 — Task Optimizer
Rewrote INTERNAL_TODO.md:
- Archived 2 newly completed HEALTH tasks:
  - [HEALTH][S] EmailImportException wrapping → Done section
  - [HEALTH][S] GlobalExceptionHandler + error.html → Done section
  - Done section now has 11 items
- Added 4 new [GROWTH] tasks from Role 3 in priority order
- Remaining [HEALTH][S] input validation task moved to top; tagged with note that it is
  BLOCKED until web controllers exist (prerequisite: Thymeleaf templates task)
- Added 2 new [MARKETING] items to TODO_MASTER.md
- Active task count: 40 tasks (1 Health, 3 Core, 30 Growth, 7 UX, 3 Infra)
- No blocked tasks except input validation (labeled with prerequisite note, not BLOCKED tag
  since it's still workable next session after templates ship)

---

### Role 6 — Health Monitor
Security:
- **No exception details exposed to users**: all error messages in GlobalExceptionHandler are
  hardcoded safe strings; exception objects are logged server-side only. Zero information leakage.
- **EmailImportException wrapping**: stack traces from Jakarta Mail are now retained in the cause
  chain (logged at WARN/ERROR) but never surfaced to the HTTP response. Clean separation.
- **Logging added**: `log.warn()` for mail/conflict errors, `log.error(ex)` with full stack trace
  for unhandled exceptions — previously all exceptions were silently swallowed after this handler
  was set up. Production observability now restored.
- No new hardcoded credentials, no SQL, no user-controlled data in error messages.

Performance:
- GlobalExceptionHandler is a Spring singleton; no state; zero overhead on the happy path.
- EmailImportException construction is O(1); negligible impact.

Code quality:
- `mailError` handler's `Exception ex` parameter now used in the log statement — no dead parameters.
- SLF4J Logger follows Spring Boot conventions (`LoggerFactory.getLogger(GlobalExceptionHandler.class)`).
- `EmailImportException` constructor is package-private — correctly scoped; only `EmailImportService`
  within the email package constructs it; `GlobalExceptionHandler` catches it by type only.

Dependencies:
- No new dependencies added this run.
- jsoup 1.17.2 still current; Spring Boot 3.5.14 still current.

Legal:
- No new legal risks introduced.
- All prior [LEGAL] items in TODO_MASTER.md remain outstanding.

## 2026-04-26 — Autonomous Run #5

### Role 1 — Feature Implementer
**Task completed**: HTML email body XSS sanitization [HEALTH][M] — CRITICAL pre-launch blocker

Files changed:
- `pom.xml` — added `org.jsoup:jsoup:1.17.2` runtime dependency.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/service/ConversationService.java` — `buildBodyHtml`
  now passes the raw HTML email body through `Jsoup.clean(html, Safelist.relaxed())` before
  returning it. This strips `<script>` tags, inline event handlers (`onclick`, `onerror`, etc.),
  `javascript:` protocol hrefs, `<iframe>`, and any other dangerous construct that malicious
  senders embed in HTML email bodies. Safe elements — `<p>`, `<b>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<a>`,
  `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, `<blockquote>`, `<code>`, `<pre>` — are preserved unchanged.
  The plain-text path (renderMarkdown) was already safe via HTML-escaping; no change needed there.

Verified: `./mvnw test` → BUILD SUCCESS, 44 tests pass.

**Income relevance**: Closes the only CRITICAL security vulnerability identified since
project start. Without sanitization, any HTML email with a `<script>` tag would execute
in every subscriber's browser. Shipping this unresolved would be a liability that could
kill the business on first security disclosure.

---

### Role 2 — Test Examiner
**Coverage added**: 4 new XSS sanitization tests in ConversationServiceTest

Tests added:
- `scriptTagsStrippedFromHtmlBody` — verifies `<script>alert('xss')</script>` is removed
  and safe content is preserved.
- `inlineEventHandlersStrippedFromHtmlBody` — verifies `onclick` is stripped from `<a>` tags.
- `javascriptLinksStrippedFromHtmlBody` — verifies `javascript:void(0)` href is removed.
- `safeHtmlElementsPreservedAfterSanitization` — verifies `<strong>` and `<em>` survive.

Also updated `htmlBodyPassesThroughWithoutTransform` to use `contains()` assertions
instead of `isEqualTo()` to be robust against jsoup output normalization differences.

Total test count: 44 (up from 40). 0 failures.

Income-critical paths still at zero coverage (code not yet written):
- Stripe webhook handler and subscription state
- User authentication flows
- IMAP polling job
- Thymeleaf template rendering

---

### Role 3 — Growth Strategist
Identified 4 new implementable growth opportunities not previously captured:

1. **Stripe customer portal integration** [GROWTH][S] — Stripe self-service portal for plan
   upgrades, downgrades, cancellations, and invoice downloads. Reduces support overhead and
   churn from users who can't find the cancel button. HIGH income impact (direct retention
   mechanism). Prerequisite: Stripe billing task.
2. **In-app upgrade preview of locked features** [GROWTH][S] — Show blurred/disabled previews
   of Team-tier features (Slack webhook, full-text search) with an "Upgrade to unlock" CTA.
   Direct upgrade-conversion trigger visible to every Personal-tier user. HIGH income impact.
3. **Send-later scheduling for replies** [GROWTH][M] — Schedule an email reply to send at a
   future time; critical for remote workers across time zones. Personal/Team plan gate. HIGH
   income impact (differentiation from standard email clients).
4. **Thread snooze** [GROWTH][S] — Snooze a thread to re-surface at a user-set time; reduces
   inbox anxiety and drives daily re-engagement. MEDIUM income impact.

Added 1 [MARKETING] item to TODO_MASTER.md:
- AppSumo lifetime deal: immediate lump-sum revenue + organic reviews.

---

### Role 4 — UX Auditor
Templates still do not exist; no live user flows to walk. One UX task completed directly in code:

**Direct fix: Participant.initials() helper** [UX][S]
- Added `initials()` method to `Participant` entity: "Alice Bob"→"AB", "alice@test.com"→"A",
  "Charlie"→"C". This is the prerequisite for the avatar rendering planned in templates — without
  it, the template author would have to inline the initials logic in Thymeleaf expressions.
- Method is a pure string function with no JPA/persistence side effects; safe to call anywhere.

Updated UX note in INTERNAL_TODO.md: "[UX][S] Bubble body HTML rendering — use th:utext"
now explicitly states that the value is "pre-rendered and already sanitized HTML" (now that
the sanitization fix is in place), so template authors don't need to add their own safeguards.

No structural UX issues possible to flag without live templates; existing UX task list in
INTERNAL_TODO.md remains accurate.

---

### Role 5 — Task Optimizer
Rewrote INTERNAL_TODO.md:
- Archived 2 newly completed tasks:
  - [HEALTH][M] HTML sanitization → Done section
  - [UX][S] Participant initials utility → Done section
  - Done section now has 9 items
- Added 4 new [GROWTH] tasks from Role 3 in priority order
- Added 1 new AppSumo [MARKETING] item to TODO_MASTER.md
- Removed duplicate mention of initials in Gravatar task (notes helper already exists)
- TODO_MASTER.md [CRITICAL] XSS item tagged [LIKELY DONE - verify] since code fix is complete
- Active task count: 40 tasks across Health (3), Core (3), Growth (26), UX (8), Infra (3) sections
- All tasks remain [S/M/L] tagged; no vague or oversized tasks
- No blocked tasks

---

### Role 6 — Health Monitor
Security:
- **XSS vector closed**: jsoup 1.17.2 `Safelist.relaxed()` sanitization is now active in
  production code path. Verified by 4 new tests covering script injection, event handler
  injection, javascript: protocol abuse, and safe-element preservation.
- jsoup 1.17.2 — no known CVEs; widely deployed in production Spring Boot applications.
  Consider upgrading to 1.18.1 when convenient (no security driver; minor API improvements).
- No new hardcoded credentials in any file added this run.
- `initials()` in Participant is pure string manipulation — no SQL, no user input reaching
  any persistence layer, no XSS risk.

Performance:
- `Jsoup.clean()` is O(n) in HTML size. For typical email bodies (< 100 KB), the overhead
  is negligible (sub-millisecond). No caching needed.
- No new N+1 query risks introduced.

Code quality:
- Comment in `buildBodyHtml` explains WHY sanitization is done (malicious sender context) —
  non-obvious to a future reader; justified. All other new code is self-explanatory.
- `initials()` follows the project convention (no unnecessary comments, no field `@Autowired`).
- Dead code check: all modified code paths are exercised by tests.

Dependencies:
- jsoup 1.17.2 added (Apache 2.0 license — compatible with commercial SaaS use, no copyleft risk).
- Spring Boot 3.5.14 still current; no new CVEs flagged.

Legal:
- jsoup is Apache 2.0 licensed — no copyleft constraint; safe for commercial closed-source use.
- All prior [LEGAL] items in TODO_MASTER.md remain outstanding (Privacy Policy, ToS, Refund
  Policy, Cookie consent) — none were addressed this run (require Master action).

## 2026-04-26 — Autonomous Run #4

### Role 1 — Feature Implementer
**Task completed**: IM transform — quoted-reply stripping, same-sender bubble grouping, markdown rendering

Files created:
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/service/IMTransformService.java` — package-private `@Service`:
  - `stripQuotes(String)`: line-by-line parser; detects "On ... wrote:" attribution (including
    wrapped multi-line variants), Outlook "-----Original Message-----" divider, and `> ` prefixed
    quote lines; cuts everything from the first attribution/divider onwards; collapses 3+ blank
    lines to 2; strips surrounding whitespace.
  - `renderMarkdown(String)`: HTML-escapes input first (prevents XSS in plain-text path), then
    applies regex transforms for **bold**, *italic*, `code`, and URL auto-linking; wraps in `<p>`
    tags at blank-line boundaries, single newlines become `<br>`.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/service/ConversationService.java` — public `@Service`:
  - `buildConversation(EmailThread)` — iterates thread's messages (already `@OrderBy sentAt ASC`),
    groups consecutive same-sender messages into `BubbleRun` instances (compared by email address,
    not DB ID, so works on unsaved entities in tests), returns an immutable `Conversation`.
  - `buildBodyHtml(Message)` — prefers `bodyHtml` from the email if present; otherwise strips
    quotes then renders plain text as markdown HTML.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/service/BubbleMessage.java` — package-private record:
  `(messageId, bodyHtml, sentAt, attachments)`.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/service/BubbleRun.java` — package-private record:
  `(sender, messages)`.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/service/Conversation.java` — public record:
  `(thread, runs)`.

Verified: `./mvnw test` → BUILD SUCCESS, 40 tests pass.

**Income relevance**: The IM transform is the product's primary value proposition — without it,
threads display as raw email walls of text, not chat bubbles. This layer directly gates all
UI work that drives conversion.

---

### Role 2 — Test Examiner
**Coverage added**: 23 new tests (14 IMTransformService + 8 ConversationService + 1 BCC import)

Files added:
- `src/test/java/com/emailmessenger/service/IMTransformServiceTest.java` (14 tests):
  - null body, non-quoted content preserved, `>` line removal, Gmail "On ... wrote:" removal,
    wrapped 2-line attribution, Outlook divider, blank-line collapsing, bold, italic, inline
    code, URL auto-link, paragraph wrapping, HTML char escaping.
- `src/test/java/com/emailmessenger/service/ConversationServiceTest.java` (8 tests):
  - empty thread, single message, same-sender grouping, different-sender splitting,
    mixed group counts, plain-to-HTML body transform, HTML body passthrough, quoted-reply stripping.
- Added `bccRecipientsAreCaptured` test to `EmailImportServiceTest` — BCC path was exercised
  in code but had zero test coverage.

Total test count: 40 (up from 17). No failures. No flaky tests.

Income-critical paths still at zero coverage (code not written yet):
- Stripe webhook handler and subscription state
- User authentication flows
- IMAP polling job
- Thymeleaf template rendering

---

### Role 3 — Growth Strategist
Added 4 new growth tasks to INTERNAL_TODO.md not previously captured:
1. **Demo mode** [GROWTH][S] — /demo route with pre-seeded sample threads; visitors experience
   the IM view without signing up; removes top-of-funnel uncertainty. HIGH income impact.
2. **Email forwarding address** [GROWTH][M] — unique @mailaim.app address per user; forwarded
   emails auto-import; avoids IMAP credential friction entirely. HIGH income impact.
3. **EML file upload** [GROWTH][S] — upload a .eml file to seed threads instantly; zero-friction
   demo path. MEDIUM income impact.
4. **Thread labels/tags** [GROWTH][M] — user-defined labels; Team plan feature gate. MEDIUM income
   impact; drives Personal → Team upgrade.

Added 2 [MARKETING] items to TODO_MASTER.md:
- Loom/YouTube demo video: highest-leverage single landing-page conversion asset.
- Chrome/Firefox extension: "Open in MailIM" button in Gmail = viral distribution loop.

---

### Role 4 — UX Auditor
Templates still do not exist; no live user flow to walk. Two new UX issues flagged from
the new service layer:
1. **Participant initials utility** [UX][S] — no method exists to compute avatar initials from
   displayName; template work will be blocked without this helper.
2. **th:utext rendering note** [UX][S] — BubbleMessage.bodyHtml contains pre-rendered HTML;
   Thymeleaf must use th:utext not th:text; flagged for the template author to avoid a subtle
   "shows raw HTML tags" bug.

---

### Role 5 — Task Optimizer
Rewrote INTERNAL_TODO.md:
- Archived 1 new completed task (IM transform) → Done section now has 7 items
- Promoted [HEALTH][M] HTML sanitization to a new "Health / Security (pre-launch blockers)"
  section at the top — it must be resolved before templates ship
- Added 4 new [GROWTH] and 2 new [UX] tasks from this run
- Consolidated growth tasks in priority order: auth/billing/limits first, then
  onboarding/SEO/virality, then engagement, then infrastructure
- Verified no duplicates across 37 active tasks
- All tasks tagged [S/M/L]

---

### Role 6 — Health Monitor
Security (one critical finding):
- **XSS in HTML email bodies** [CRITICAL]: `ConversationService.buildBodyHtml` returns
  `msg.getBodyHtml()` directly without sanitization. When Thymeleaf renders this with `th:utext`,
  any `<script>`, event handler, or iframe in an incoming email executes in the user's browser.
  Fix: add jsoup to pom.xml and call `Jsoup.clean(bodyHtml, Safelist.relaxed())` before returning.
  Added [CRITICAL] note to TODO_MASTER.md and [HEALTH][M] task to INTERNAL_TODO.md.
- The plain-text path (`renderMarkdown`) is safe: HTML is escaped before any regex transformation,
  so no injection is possible through the markdown renderer.

Performance:
- `IMTransformService.stripQuotes` is O(n) in number of lines; no regex backtracking risk since
  all patterns are simple anchored or character-class patterns.
- `ConversationService.buildConversation` is O(n) in messages; produces `List.copyOf` snapshots —
  immutable and safe to cache.

Code quality:
- `IMTransformService` and view model records (`BubbleMessage`, `BubbleRun`) are package-private —
  correctly scoped; only `ConversationService` and `Conversation` are public.
- Constructor injection in `ConversationService`; no field `@Autowired`.
- No dead code. All 5 new files are exercised by tests.

Dependencies:
- No new runtime dependencies added this run. jsoup needed for the HTML sanitization fix (tracked).

Legal: no change from prior runs — all open [LEGAL] items in TODO_MASTER.md remain outstanding.

---

## 2026-04-26 — Autonomous Run #3

### Role 1 — Feature Implementer
**Task completed**: Email-import service — RFC 822 parsing + thread building

Files created:
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/email/ParsedEmail.java` — package-private record holding
  all parsed fields from a MimeMessage before DB operations: messageId, inReplyTo, references
  (List<String>), subject, from, to/cc/bcc recipients, bodyPlain, bodyHtml, attachments, sentAt.
  Two nested records: `AddressEntry(email, name)` and `AttachmentEntry(filename, mimeType, sizeBytes)`.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/email/MimeMessageParser.java` — package-private class that
  walks a `MimeMessage` tree: extracts RFC 5322 headers, recursively walks `multipart/*` to find
  `text/plain` / `text/html` parts, collects attachment metadata (filename, mimeType, size).
  Does NOT read attachment byte content — only metadata; blob_ref is wired separately.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/email/EmailImportService.java` — `@Service` with
  `@Transactional` import method:
  - Idempotent: skips if Message-ID already exists in the database.
  - Thread resolution: walks References list newest-first per RFC 5322, falls back to In-Reply-To,
    then rootMessageId lookup, then creates a new EmailThread.
  - `resolveParticipant()`: find-or-create Participant by normalised email address.
  - Attachment metadata captured; `blob_ref` is null until external storage is wired.
  - Save order: `messageRepo.save(message)` first so the subsequent `threadRepo.save(thread)`
    cascade-merges an already-managed entity (avoids double-INSERT unique constraint violation).

Bug found and fixed during test run: original code called `thread.addMessage(message)` +
`threadRepo.save(thread)` (which cascades ALL to the unsaved message entity, inserting it), then
called `messageRepo.save(message)` again — violating the `message_id_header` unique constraint.
Fix: save message first, then add to thread, then save thread.

Verified: `./mvnw test` → BUILD SUCCESS, 17 tests pass.

**Income relevance**: Email parsing and thread building are the core data pipeline. Without this,
no thread can ever appear in the UI — it is the prerequisite for all user-visible value.

---

### Role 2 — Test Examiner
**Coverage added**: 6 new tests in `EmailImportServiceTest` (17 total, up from 11)

File created: `src/test/java/com/emailmessenger/email/EmailImportServiceTest.java`
- `importCreatesThreadAndMessage` — verifies thread, message, sender, body, rootMessageId
- `replyViaInReplyToJoinsExistingThread` — verifies In-Reply-To links reply to parent thread; checks messageCount=2
- `replyViaReferencesJoinsExistingThread` — verifies References header thread linking
- `duplicateMessageIdIsSkipped` — verifies idempotency returns empty + only one DB row
- `senderParticipantIsDeduplicated` — verifies two messages from same address → 1 Participant
- `toAndCcRecipientsAreCaptured` — verifies RecipientType.TO (×2) and CC (×1) stored correctly

Tests use `@SpringBootTest @ActiveProfiles("dev") @Transactional` with H2; each test rolls back.
MimeMessage instances built in-process via `jakarta.mail.Session.getInstance(new Properties())`.

Income-critical paths with zero coverage (code not yet written — expected):
- Stripe webhook handler and subscription state
- User authentication flows
- IM transform (quoted-reply stripping)
- IMAP polling job

No flaky tests. No redundant tests. No test failures.

---

### Role 3 — Growth Strategist
Added 5 new growth tasks to INTERNAL_TODO.md (not previously captured):
1. **Thread permalink sharing** [GROWTH][M] — shareable read-only `/share/{token}` link is a
   viral touchpoint; every person who receives a link gets a demo of the product. HIGH income impact.
2. **Browser push notifications** [GROWTH][S] — Web Push API re-engages users without requiring
   them to keep the tab open; drives daily active usage. MEDIUM income impact.
3. **Slack/Discord webhook integration** [GROWTH][M] — sends a Slack/Discord notification when
   a new email arrives; this is a natural $29/mo Team plan feature gate. HIGH income impact.
4. **Thread export (PDF/HTML)** [GROWTH][M] — freelancers and support teams need to export
   conversations; this is a paid-tier feature gate. MEDIUM income impact.
5. **In-app referral prompt** [GROWTH][S] — triggered after activation milestone (10 threads
   imported); shows tweet + copy-link modal. MEDIUM income impact.

Added 2 [MARKETING] items to TODO_MASTER.md:
- Slack/Discord community for early users
- Channel-specific announcement when webhook integration ships

---

### Role 4 — UX Auditor
No Thymeleaf templates exist yet so no live user flows to walk. All 5 previously flagged UX
issues remain in INTERNAL_TODO.md. Added 2 new UX issues specific to the import service now built:
1. **Import error feedback** [UX][S] — MessagingException/IOException from import currently
   bubbles up as a 500. Needs a user-visible error banner or toast, not a crash page.
2. **IMAP sync status indicator** [UX][S] — thread list should show "last synced X minutes ago"
   so users know whether they're seeing live data; critical for trust in the product.

---

### Role 5 — Task Optimizer
Audited and rewrote INTERNAL_TODO.md:
- Archived 1 new completed task (Email Import Service) → Done section now has 6 items
- Added 5 new [GROWTH] tasks from Role 3 in priority order (below existing Growth items)
- Added 2 new [UX] tasks from Role 4
- Added 1 new [HEALTH] task: wrap mail exceptions in domain exception
- Confirmed no duplicates across 30 active tasks
- All tasks remain tagged [S/M/L]; no vague or oversized tasks
- No blocked tasks

---

### Role 6 — Health Monitor
Security (no critical issues):
- No hardcoded credentials in any new file
- `MimeMessageParser` handles null Message-ID, null sender, null sent date defensively
- `resolveParticipant` normalises email to lowercase before lookup/storage — prevents duplicate
  Participants from case-variant addresses (e.g. Alice@Test.com vs alice@test.com)
- `importMessage` is idempotent on Message-ID — safe to call from a polling job without
  duplicate-import protection at the job level

Performance:
- `walkParts` recursion depth is bounded by the message structure (typically 2–3 levels);
  no risk of stack overflow for standard RFC 822 messages
- `resolveParticipant` does a SELECT before every INSERT — acceptable for import volumes,
  but may become a bottleneck in bulk-import scenarios (flagged for future batching)
- `resolveThread` does up to N+1 SELECTs for messages in the References list (worst case:
  long References chain with no match). Low risk at current scale; indexed on message_id_header.

Code quality:
- `MimeMessageParser` is package-private (correctly scoped)
- `ParsedEmail` is a record — immutable, no mutable state
- Constructor injection enforced; no `@Autowired` fields
- `(String) part.getContent()` cast in `walkParts` is guarded by `isMimeType("text/plain")`
  and `isMimeType("text/html")` checks — Jakarta Mail guarantees String content for those types

Flagged:
- `MessagingException` and `IOException` leak through `EmailImportService.importMessage()` as
  checked exceptions — added [HEALTH][S] task to wrap in a domain exception
- No rate limiting on import volume per user — will need enforcement when IMAP polling ships

Legal (no change from Run #2 — all items still open in TODO_MASTER.md [LEGAL]).

---

## 2026-04-26 — Autonomous Run #2

### Role 1 — Feature Implementer
**Tasks completed**: Flyway V1__init.sql + domain entities + Spring Data repositories

Files created:
- `src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__init.sql` — 5 tables (participants, email_threads,
  messages, message_recipients, attachments) with FK constraints and 6 performance indexes.
  SQL is ANSI-standard `GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY` — runs on both H2 (test) and
  PostgreSQL (production) without a compatibility layer.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/domain/` — 6 files:
  - `Participant.java` — `@Entity`, deduped by email, `@PrePersist` createdAt
  - `EmailThread.java` — `@Entity`, `@OneToMany messages`, `@PrePersist/@PreUpdate` timestamps,
    `addMessage()` helper increments messageCount
  - `Message.java` — `@Entity`, `@ManyToOne thread + sender`, `@OneToMany recipients + attachments`,
    `addRecipient()` / `addAttachment()` helpers
  - `MessageRecipient.java` — `@Entity`, `@ManyToOne message + participant`, `RecipientType` enum
  - `Attachment.java` — `@Entity`, `@ManyToOne message`, blob_ref for storage pointer
  - `RecipientType.java` — enum `TO / CC / BCC`
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/repository/` — 4 interfaces:
  - `ParticipantRepository` — `findByEmail`, `existsByEmail`
  - `EmailThreadRepository` — `findByRootMessageId`, `findAllByOrderByUpdatedAtDesc(Pageable)`
  - `MessageRepository` — `findByMessageIdHeader`, `findByThreadIdOrderBySentAtAsc`
  - `AttachmentRepository` — `findByMessageId`

Verified: `./mvnw test` → BUILD SUCCESS, all tests pass.

**Income relevance**: Domain model and persistence layer are the foundation for all features
that drive revenue — user threads, message history, attachment storage. Nothing billable ships
without this layer.

---

### Role 2 — Test Examiner
**Coverage added**: 10 new tests across 3 test classes (11 total, up from 1).

Files added:
- `ParticipantRepositoryTest` (3 tests): save/find by email, existsByEmail, unique constraint enforcement
- `EmailThreadRepositoryTest` (4 tests): save/find thread, ordered by updatedAt, message persistence, findByMessageIdHeader
- `AttachmentRepositoryTest` (3 tests): save/find by message ID, multiple attachments per message, TO/CC recipient types

Income-critical paths still at zero coverage (code not yet written — expected):
- Stripe webhook handler and subscription state transitions
- User authentication (login, registration, session)
- IMAP ingestion and thread-building logic
- IM transform (quoted-reply stripping)

No flaky tests. No redundant tests. No test failures. Added TEST-FAILURE tagging protocol to
INTERNAL_TODO.md for when those paths are built.

---

### Role 3 — Growth Strategist
Added 5 new implementable growth tasks to INTERNAL_TODO.md:
1. **Google OAuth SSO** [GROWTH][S] — Removes password friction at signup; Gmail users get
   mailbox auto-connected. HIGH income impact. Added credential step to TODO_MASTER.md.
2. **First-run onboarding wizard** [GROWTH][M] — Guided "connect your mailbox" flow.
   Reduces activation drop-off = more users reach the Aha moment = more conversions.
3. **Upgrade prompts at limit** [GROWTH][S] — Inline modal when free tier hits 500 threads
   or 1 mailbox. Direct revenue trigger. HIGH income impact.
4. **Email digest notifications** [GROWTH][M] — Daily/weekly re-engagement email. Reduces
   churn. MEDIUM income impact.
5. **SEO landing page** [GROWTH][M] — Static / with features + pricing. Organic traffic
   from "email as chat" searches. MEDIUM income impact.

Added [MARKETING] Google OAuth ToS review item to TODO_MASTER.md.

---

### Role 4 — UX Auditor
No Thymeleaf templates exist yet so no live user flows to audit. Flagged 5 specific
UX issues for when templates are built (added to INTERNAL_TODO.md tagged [UX]):
1. Thread list empty state — blank page with no CTA when no threads exist
2. Conversation empty state — blank panel when thread has no messages
3. Error pages — Spring Whitelabel error page exposed to users; needs custom error.html
4. Reply button prominence — must be primary action, not buried below message list
5. Mobile layout — 375px viewport pass required for chat bubbles

---

### Role 5 — Task Optimizer
Audited and rewrote INTERNAL_TODO.md:
- Archived 5 completed tasks to Done section
- Organized into sections: Core, Growth/Revenue, UX, Health, Infrastructure
- Consolidated duplicate upgrade-prompt mentions into one task
- Re-prioritized: Core income-blocking features first, then Growth, UX, Health, Infra
- All tasks tagged [S/M/L]; no oversized tasks remain
- No blocked tasks (all dependencies either done or not yet needed)

---

### Role 6 — Health Monitor
Security audit (no issues found):
- No hardcoded credentials in any source file
- `application.yml` prod profile uses env-var placeholders throughout
- No `@Autowired` field injection (constructor injection enforced by convention)
- `open-in-view=false` prevents lazy-load-over-HTTP session leaks

Performance review:
- 6 indexes added in V1__init.sql covering all FK columns and common sort keys
  (`updated_at DESC`, `sent_at DESC`) — N+1 risk on unindexed FKs eliminated at schema level
- `FetchType.LAZY` on all `@ManyToOne` and `@OneToMany` relations — no eager cross-table fetches
- No unbounded list queries; `EmailThreadRepository.findAllByOrderByUpdatedAtDesc` uses `Pageable`

Code quality:
- No dead code; all 6 entity classes and 4 repositories are actively referenced in tests
- `Collections.unmodifiableList()` on collection getters in EmailThread and Message —
  prevents external mutation of managed collections
- No unused dependencies

Dependencies:
- Spring Boot 3.5.14 (latest 3.x); no known CVEs in current dep set
- H2 2.3 (bundled by Spring Boot) — no known issues
- Testcontainers 1.20.4 — current stable

Legal (no change from Run #1):
- Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Refund Policy, Cookie banner still outstanding
- Flagged in TODO_MASTER.md [LEGAL] — no action taken (code-level task; requires Master)

## 2026-04-25 — Autonomous Run #1 (Bootstrap)

### First Run — APP_SPEC.md created
- Defined application: **MailIM** — email-to-instant-message SaaS
- Business model: Freemium subscription ($0 / $9 / $29 / $99 per month)
- Target users: remote workers, support teams, freelancers

### Role 1 — Feature Implementer
**Task implemented**: Scaffold Maven project + Add starters (CLAUDE.md items 2 and 3)

Files created:
- `pom.xml` — Spring Boot 3.5.14, Java 21; starters: web, thymeleaf, data-jpa,
  validation, mail, flyway-core, flyway-database-postgresql; runtime: postgresql;
  test: h2, spring-boot-starter-test, testcontainers-bom, testcontainers-postgresql
- `.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.properties` — Maven 3.9.11
- `mvnw` / `mvnw.cmd` — generated by `mvn wrapper:wrapper`
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/EmailMessengerApplication.java`
- `src/main/resources/application.yml` — dev profile (H2 in-memory) and prod profile
  (PostgreSQL via env vars DB_URL / DB_USER / DB_PASS)
- `src/test/java/com/emailmessenger/EmailMessengerApplicationTests.java`

Verified: `./mvnw test` → BUILD SUCCESS, 1 test, 0 failures.

**Income relevance**: Compiling foundation for all income-generating features.

### Role 2 — Test Examiner
- Reviewed test suite: 1 test (`contextLoads`) passes; application context boots
  correctly against H2 with Flyway (0 migrations, schema empty — expected).
- Income-critical paths with zero test coverage (expected — code not yet written):
  - Stripe payments / billing webhooks
  - User authentication and registration
  - IMAP email ingestion and thread building
  - IM transform (quoted-reply stripping)
- No flaky or redundant tests. No test failures.
- Added test coverage tasks to INTERNAL_TODO.md for when features are built.

### Role 3 — Growth Strategist
Identified highest-leverage income opportunities and added to INTERNAL_TODO.md:
1. **Stripe billing** [GROWTH][M] — direct revenue unlock; no paying users without it
2. **User auth** [GROWTH][M] — prerequisite for billing; needed for multi-tenancy
3. **Plan-limit enforcement** [GROWTH][S] — creates upgrade pressure on free users
4. **Gravatar + initials avatars** [GROWTH][M] — improves perceived quality → conversion
5. **Unread tracking** [GROWTH][S] — engagement + daily active usage driver
6. **Full-text search** [GROWTH][M] — key feature gate for Personal/Team upgrade
7. **Referral link** [GROWTH][S] — viral loop for organic growth

Added marketing actions to TODO_MASTER.md: Product Hunt, directory listings, SEO
content, community posts, waitlist landing page.

### Role 4 — Task Optimizer
- Created INTERNAL_TODO.md with full task backlog in priority order
- Archived completed scaffold tasks
- All tasks tagged by priority, size, and category
- No duplicates found (first run)
- Blocked tasks: none yet

### Role 5 — Health Monitor
Security:
- No hardcoded credentials found in any file
- `application.yml` prod profile uses `${DB_URL}`, `${DB_USER}`, `${DB_PASS}`,
  `${MAIL_HOST}`, `${MAIL_USER}`, `${MAIL_PASS}` env-var placeholders — safe
- No payment flows present yet — no PCI exposure

Performance:
- No entities or queries yet — N+1 analysis deferred to when entities exist
- `spring.jpa.open-in-view=false` set in both profiles (avoids lazy-load antipattern)

Dependencies:
- Spring Boot 3.5.14 (latest 3.x stable as of 2026-04-25)
- No known CVEs flagged in current dep set (Hibernate 6.6.49, Flyway bundled)

Legal (flagged in TODO_MASTER.md [LEGAL]):
- No Privacy Policy page
- No Terms of Service page
- No Refund Policy page
- Cookie consent banner not yet implemented
- All above required before accepting payments or EU/CCPA-covered users

Code quality:
- Only 3 Java files; no dead code, no repeated logic
- `open-in-view=false` already set to prevent common JPA antipattern
