# Changelog

## 2026-04-27 — Autonomous Run #13

### Role 1 — Feature Implementer
**Task completed**: SEO-friendly marketing landing page at `/` [GROWTH][M] — HIGH income impact

**What was built**:
- `LandingController.java` — `GET /` now serves a full marketing landing page; `waitlistCount` from `WaitlistEntryRepository.count()` passed to model for social proof.
- `index.html` — hero section (headline, subhead, dual CTA), 6-card feature grid (chat bubbles, quote stripping, IMAP, inline reply, dark mode, keyboard shortcuts), 3-plan pricing preview with highlighted "Most popular" card, bottom CTA section on brand-color background, site footer with nav links; JSON-LD `SoftwareApplication` schema; `<link rel="canonical">`.
- `main.css` — ~200 lines of landing-page CSS: `.landing-hero`, `.feature-grid`, `.feature-card`, `.preview-plan-row`, `.landing-cta-section`, `.landing-footer`, responsive breakpoints at 900px/560px, dark-mode overrides.
- `ThreadController.java` — removed the stale `GET /` → `redirect:/threads` handler (route now owned by `LandingController`).
- `ThreadControllerTest.java` — removed `rootRedirectsToThreads` (stale test for moved route).
- `LandingControllerTest.java` (new, 3 tests) — verifies `GET /` returns `index` view, exposes `waitlistCount`, and handles zero count.

**Income relevance**: The landing page is the entry point for all organic search and social traffic. Without it, every visitor hit an empty thread list. The hero shows the value proposition, the feature grid closes objections, the pricing preview creates upgrade intent, and dual CTAs funnel visitors to demo (no friction) or waitlist (lead capture). Social proof count in hero adds credibility.

---

### Role 2 — Test Examiner
**Coverage audit**: Reviewed all controllers for untested paths.

**Gaps found and fixed**:
- `LegalController` (`/privacy`, `/terms`) had zero tests despite being linked from pricing, footer, and FAQ. Created `LegalControllerTest.java` (2 tests: both routes return 200 + correct view name).
- `WaitlistControllerTest.getWaitlistReturns200AndWaitlistView` — updated to stub `count()` and assert `waitlistCount` is in the model (covers new social-proof model attribute added this run).

**Coverage status**: 103 tests, 0 failures. All income-critical paths (waitlist, landing, pricing, demo, legal) are covered. `LegalController` gap closed.

---

### Role 3 — Growth Strategist
**Opportunities identified**:

1. **Waitlist confirmation email** [GROWTH][S] — Already in backlog (top priority, HIGH impact). Blocked on email provider credentials (Postmark/Resend). No new code needed until credentials arrive.
2. **Demo page SEO enhancement** [GROWTH][S] — `/demo` has OG tags but no JSON-LD schema and no keyword-rich H2 or feature bullets. Low effort, medium SEO value.
3. **Canonical URLs on remaining public pages** [GROWTH][S] — `index.html` now has one; still missing on `demo.html`, `waitlist.html`, `pricing.html`, `threads.html`, `conversation.html`, `error.html`. Task updated in INTERNAL_TODO.
4. **Landing page A/B: hero CTA copy** [GROWTH][S] — "Join the waitlist →" vs "Get early access →" — no code needed but worth noting for future test.
5. (No new INTERNAL_TODO items needed beyond updating existing — backlog is already comprehensive.)

**No new TODO_MASTER items** — existing marketing items cover distribution of the landing page URL.

---

### Role 4 — UX Auditor
**Flows audited**: `/` (new landing) → `/waitlist` → `/demo` → `/threads` (app)

**Fixed directly**:
- `waitlist.html` brand logo: was `<a href="/threads">` — updated to `<a href="/">`. Visitors on the waitlist page had no way back to the landing page via the brand.
- `waitlist.html` header CTA: was "Open App →" pointing to `/threads` (empty screen for unauthenticated users) — changed to "Try demo →" pointing to `/demo`. Now leads visitors to the highest-value no-friction experience.
- `demo.html` top banner CTA: was "Connect your mailbox →" pointing to `/threads` (dead end pre-auth) — changed to "Join the waitlist →" pointing to `/waitlist`. Converts engaged demo visitors into waitlist leads.
- `threads.html` brand: was a `<span>` with no link — upgraded to `<a href="/" class="brand brand-link">`. App users can now navigate home from the thread list.
- `waitlist.html` — added live "Join X others on the waitlist" count (social proof) below the form for users in the form state.

**Flagged in INTERNAL_TODO.md**:
- `/privacy` and `/terms` pages are dead-ends: no header nav, no footer, no way back to the app. Added `[UX][S]` task to add consistent nav header.

---

### Role 5 — Task Optimizer
**INTERNAL_TODO.md cleanup**:
- Archived to Done: SEO landing page [GROWTH][M], waitlist count social proof [GROWTH][S], nav dead-ends UX fix [UX][S] (3 items).
- Replaced stale dark-mode legal notice UX item (already fixed in Run #12) with new dead-end navigation item for /privacy and /terms.
- Updated canonical URL task to note index.html is done and list remaining pages.
- No duplicates found. No new items added (backlog covers all identified opportunities).
- Backlog remains well-prioritized: income-critical and auth-free items lead, auth-gated items grouped, BLOCKED items noted.

---

### Role 6 — Health Monitor
**Audited**: security, code quality, dependencies, legal.

**Security**:
- `LandingController` reads only `WaitlistEntryRepository.count()` — no user input, no SQL injection risk.
- Landing page template uses only `th:text` (auto-escaped) and `th:if` — no XSS vectors.
- No new endpoints accept POST data; no CSRF surface added.

**Code quality**:
- `ThreadController` cleaned: removed the `GET /` redirect that was now a dead route with `LandingController` owning `/`. No dead code remains.
- No new dead code or duplicate logic introduced this run.

**Performance**:
- `LandingController` calls `count()` on every page load — an O(1) aggregation query. Acceptable. Consider caching with `@Cacheable` once traffic justifies it (add to backlog).
- No N+1 queries introduced.

**Legal**:
- `/privacy` and `/terms` stub pages remain (no real legal copy). Flagged in TODO_MASTER — still required before accepting payments.
- `index.html` does not collect any user data (no forms), no cookie consent required for the landing page itself.

**No new INTERNAL_TODO or TODO_MASTER items added** (existing items cover all findings).

## 2026-04-27 — Autonomous Run #12

### Role 1 — Feature Implementer
**Task completed**: Waitlist email capture page at `/waitlist` [GROWTH][S] — HIGH income impact

Files created:
- `src/main/resources/db/migration/V2__waitlist.sql` — `waitlist_entries` table with unique email constraint and created_at index.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/domain/WaitlistEntry.java` — JPA entity.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/repository/WaitlistEntryRepository.java` — `existsByEmail()` for duplicate detection.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/web/WaitlistForm.java` — `@Email @NotBlank @Size(max=254)` + strip() on set.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/web/WaitlistController.java` — `GET /waitlist` (show form), `POST /waitlist` (save or detect duplicate, redirect with flash). Catches `DataIntegrityViolationException` for concurrent duplicates.
- `src/main/resources/templates/waitlist.html` — three states: default form, success (joined), already-joined. Feature list, privacy note, demo link, OG/meta tags.
- Waitlist and legal page CSS added to `main.css`.

Files updated:
- `pricing.html` — Personal and Team plan CTAs changed from `/threads` to `/waitlist`; privacy/TOS footer links fixed from `#` to `/privacy` and `/terms`.
- `demo.html` — header CTA and bottom CTA updated to `/waitlist`.
- `threads.html` — empty state CTA updated from broken `/settings/mailboxes` to `/waitlist`; `Waitlist` added to header nav.
- `conversation.html` — demo banner "Connect your own mailbox" updated to "Join the waitlist →" pointing to `/waitlist`.

**Income relevance**: Waitlist captures leads before auth ships; replaces dead-end CTAs across 4 templates; every visitor who clicks "Join waitlist" is a qualified lead.

---

### Role 2 — Test Examiner
**Coverage added**: Waitlist income-critical path — 9 new tests (6 controller, 3 repository)

- `WaitlistControllerTest` — GET shows form; POST new email saves + redirect with `joined` flash; POST duplicate redirects with `alreadyJoined` flash (no save); POST blank email returns form with field errors; POST invalid email returns form with field errors; POST trims whitespace before save.
- `WaitlistEntryRepositoryTest` — saves entry and `existsByEmail` works; duplicate email throws `DataIntegrityViolationException`; `createdAt` is populated.
- **Total tests: 99, 0 failures.**

---

### Role 3 — Growth Strategist
New items added to `INTERNAL_TODO.md`:
1. **Waitlist confirmation email** [GROWTH][S] — HIGH impact; transactional email on signup keeps leads warm. Prerequisite: email provider credentials (see TODO_MASTER.md).
2. **Waitlist count social proof** [GROWTH][S] — MEDIUM; live count on waitlist page drives FOMO.
3. **Canonical URL on all public pages** [GROWTH][S] — LOW; prevents duplicate-content SEO penalties.
4. **SEO landing page at /** [GROWTH][M] — HIGH; current / redirects to empty /threads; a marketing page is the highest-leverage remaining SEO task.

New items added to `TODO_MASTER.md`:
- `[MARKETING]` Post waitlist URL on social channels with demo link.
- `[MARKETING]` Set up transactional email provider (Postmark/Resend/SendGrid) and configure env vars.

---

### Role 4 — UX Auditor
**Flows audited**: Landing → Pricing → Waitlist → Demo → Conversation (demo mode)

**Fixed directly**:
- Created `/privacy` stub page (`LegalController` + `privacy.html`) — was a dead `href="#"` link on pricing footer and FAQ.
- Created `/terms` stub page (`LegalController` + `terms.html`) — same.
- Pricing footer and FAQ privacy link updated from `#` to real `/privacy` and `/terms`.
- Demo conversation banner "Connect your own mailbox →" → "Join the waitlist →" (`/waitlist`).
- Threads empty state "Connect Your Mailbox →" (pointed to non-existent `/settings/mailboxes`) → "Join the waitlist →" with clearer pre-launch copy.

**Flagged in INTERNAL_TODO.md**:
- `[UX][S]` Dark-mode legal notice (.legal-notice) uses hardcoded yellow — added dark-mode CSS override this session.
- `[UX][S]` Legal placeholder notice must be replaced with real legal copy before accepting payments.

---

### Role 5 — Task Optimizer
- Archived 5 newly-completed UX and GROWTH tasks to Done section.
- Moved `[BLOCKED]` health tasks (CSRF, rate-limiting) to bottom of their section with explicit `[BLOCKED]` tag.
- Consolidated `Robots.txt` and `Sitemap.xml controller` into a single combined task.
- Added `SEO landing page at /` to the top of the No-Prerequisite Growth section (HIGH impact, previously mid-list).
- Moved `Waitlist confirmation email` and `Waitlist count social proof` to the top of no-prerequisite items (prerequisites now met).
- Overall backlog reduced from ~55 active items to ~48 by deduplication and archiving.

---

### Role 6 — Health Monitor
**Audited**: security, SQL injection, XSS, code quality, dependencies, legal.

**Findings**:
- No hardcoded credentials. All secrets use env-var placeholders. ✓
- No SQL injection risk: all Spring Data queries use JPQL with `@Param`/method derivation. ✓
- `th:utext` in conversation.html is safe: bodies are pre-sanitized by jsoup in `ConversationService.buildBodyHtml`. ✓
- `innerHTML` in conversation.html day-separator JS: input is `#temporals.format(date, 'yyyy-MM-dd')` (digits + hyphens only); `formatDateLabel` returns only static locale text. No XSS risk. ✓
- WaitlistForm strips email whitespace (`.strip()`). ✓
- `DataIntegrityViolationException` catch in WaitlistController handles concurrent duplicate inserts gracefully. ✓

**Fixed directly**:
- Dark-mode legal notice box (`.legal-notice`): added `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` overrides so the yellow warning box is readable in dark mode.

**Flagged in INTERNAL_TODO.md**:
- jsoup 1.17.2 is not the latest (1.18.x released 2024); no known critical CVEs but upgrade is prudent.

**Legal**:
- `/privacy` and `/terms` stub pages created (previously 404); legal placeholder notice clearly warns that real legal copy is required before accepting payments.
- Flagged in TODO_MASTER.md: transactional email provider setup needed for waitlist confirmation email.

## 2026-04-27 — Autonomous Run #11

### Role 1 — Feature Implementer
**Task completed**: Demo mode at `/demo` [GROWTH][S] — HIGH income impact

Files created/changed:
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/domain/EmailThread.java` — added `public void setMessageCount(int n)` setter; needed to populate messageCount on transient (non-persisted) EmailThread objects used by DemoService.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/service/DemoService.java` — new `@Service`; `public record DemoCatalogEntry(int id, String subject, int messageCount, LocalDateTime updatedAt)` for the thread list; 5 static `Participant` objects (SARAH, MARCUS, DIANA, JAMES, YOU); `listThreads()` returns 2 catalog entries with fresh times on each call; `getConversation(int id)` returns `null` for unknown id; private `buildConv1()` (3 messages, Q3 marketing results thread, Yesterday) and `buildConv2()` (5 messages across 4 bubble runs demonstrating same-sender grouping, today's onboarding thread); builds `BubbleRun`/`BubbleMessage` directly (package-private, same `service` package); no DB queries.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/web/DemoController.java` — new package-private `@Controller`; `GET /demo` → `"demo"` view with `demoThreads`, `today`, `yesterday` model attrs; `GET /demo/{id}` → `"conversation"` view with `conversation` + `isDemo=true`; throws `NoSuchElementException` for unknown id (→ GlobalExceptionHandler 404).
- `src/main/resources/templates/demo.html` — thread list landing page: sticky header with brand + Demo badge + "Start free →" CTA; blue info banner ("no signup required"); thread list reusing existing `.thread-item` CSS; demo CTA section at bottom ("Ready to transform your inbox?"). OG/meta-description tags added.
- `src/main/resources/templates/conversation.html` — 3 changes: (1) back-link uses `th:href` that resolves to `/demo` when `isDemo=true` else `/threads`; (2) kbd hint replaced with "Demo — Connect your mailbox →" CTA link when in demo mode; (3) `<div class="demo-banner">` inserted between conv-header and conv-body when `isDemo=true`; (4) reply-area div wrapped with `th:unless="${isDemo != null and isDemo}"` so reply form is completely hidden in demo.
- `src/main/resources/templates/threads.html` — added "Demo" nav link; added "Not ready to connect? Try the demo first →" paragraph to the empty-state.
- `src/main/resources/templates/pricing.html` — added "Demo" nav link; removed inline `style="..."` on header CTA button (replaced with `.btn-sm` CSS class); added "Not sure yet? Try the live demo" hint below billing toggle.
- `src/main/resources/static/css/main.css` — added `.demo-badge`, `.btn-sm`, `.demo-banner`, `.demo-header-cta`, `.demo-page-banner`, `.demo-cta-section`, `.demo-cta-actions`, `.demo-cta-link`, `.empty-state-demo`, `.pricing-demo-hint`; dark-mode overrides for demo banner and demo page banner.

Verified: `./mvnw test` → BUILD SUCCESS, 90 tests pass (up from 76).

**Income relevance**: The demo page is the most powerful top-of-funnel asset: any visitor who lands on `/pricing` or hears about MailIM can experience the core product value (email → chat bubbles) without signing up. Every future social post, directory listing (Product Hunt, AlternativeTo), and word-of-mouth mention can link to `/demo` to convert curious visitors into signups. The demo-to-signup funnel (banner → "Connect your mailbox →") is now live.

---

### Role 2 — Test Examiner
**Coverage added**: 14 new tests (90 total, up from 76)

Tests added:
- `DemoServiceTest` (9 tests, new file — `com.emailmessenger.service` package for access to package-private types):
  - `listThreadsReturnsTwoEntries` — catalog always returns exactly 2 entries
  - `catalogEntriesHaveCorrectMessageCounts` — conv 1 = 3 messages, conv 2 = 5 messages
  - `catalogEntriesHaveNonBlankSubjects` — both subjects non-blank
  - `demoConversation1HasThreeBubbleMessages` — sums BubbleMessage count across all runs = 3
  - `demoConversation2HasFiveBubbleMessages` — sums BubbleMessage count across all runs = 5 (JAMES sends 2 consecutive to demonstrate same-sender grouping)
  - `demoConversationSubjectsMatchCatalog` — thread subject == catalog entry subject for id 1 and 2
  - `demoConversationBodiesContainSafeHtml` — verifies no `<script>` tags in any demo body
  - `unknownDemoIdReturnsNull` — id 0 and 99 return null
  - `demoConversationSentAtTimesAreChronological` — all sentAt timestamps in conv 2 are non-decreasing

- `DemoControllerTest` (5 tests, new file):
  - `demoListReturns200WithDemoThreads` — GET /demo → 200, view="demo", model has demoThreads/today/yesterday
  - `demoListContainsTwoSampleThreads` — demoThreads list size = 2
  - `demoConversation1Returns200WithConversationView` — GET /demo/1 → 200, view="conversation", isDemo=true
  - `demoConversation2Returns200WithConversationView` — GET /demo/2 → 200, view="conversation", isDemo=true
  - `demoConversationUnknownIdReturns404` — GET /demo/99 → 404, view="error"

Bug caught by test: Initial `buildConv2()` set `messageCount(4)` and catalog entry had `messageCount=4`, but the conversation actually has 5 BubbleMessages (JAMES sends 2 consecutive, which is a deliberate UX demonstration of same-sender grouping). Fixed both to 5.

Coverage status:
- `DemoService`: fully covered (catalog, conversations 1+2, unknown id, chronological times, safe HTML).
- `DemoController`: fully covered (list, both conversations, 404 path).
- `EmailThread.setMessageCount()`: covered indirectly via DemoService tests.
- Income-critical paths still at zero coverage: Stripe webhook, user auth flows (not yet implemented).

---

### Role 3 — Growth Strategist
2 new [GROWTH] tasks added (not previously captured):

1. **Demo page SEO optimization** [GROWTH][S] — Add keyword-rich subheading, feature bullet list, and JSON-LD `SoftwareApplication` schema to `/demo`; targets "email as chat app", "email IM view" searches; each organic visitor who lands on `/demo` can experience the product without signup friction. MEDIUM income impact. Prerequisite: demo (done ✓).
2. **Robots.txt endpoint** [GROWTH][S] — Spring `@Controller` returning `/robots.txt`; `Allow: /demo, /pricing, /`; `Disallow: /threads, /settings`; includes sitemap link. LOW impact, ensures search engines index public pages and don't crawl auth-gated pages. No prerequisites.

1 new [MARKETING] item added to TODO_MASTER.md:
- Add /demo URL to all social profiles (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, IndieHackers) and post a screen-recording announcement. /demo is the lowest-friction marketing asset for every channel.

---

### Role 4 — UX Auditor
Audited flows: pricing page hero → plan selection, threads empty state → demo discovery, demo thread list → demo conversation view.

**Direct fixes applied:**
1. **"Try the demo" hint on pricing page** (`pricing.html`): Added `<p class="pricing-demo-hint">Not sure yet? <a href="/demo">Try the live demo</a> — no signup required.</p>` below the billing toggle in the pricing hero. Visitors who aren't ready to commit to signup can now discover the demo directly from the pricing page — the second-most-trafficked page after the landing.
2. **Demo nav link in pricing.html** (`pricing.html`): Added "Demo" link to header nav; removed inline `style="..."` on the "Open App →" button (replaced with `.btn-sm` CSS class). Pricing page header now matches the threads.html navigation pattern.
3. **Demo nav link in threads.html** (`threads.html`): Added "Demo" link to the header nav.
4. **Empty-state demo CTA** (`threads.html`): Added "Not ready to connect? Try the demo first →" below the primary "Connect Your Mailbox →" CTA. New users who arrive with no threads now have a fallback path (demo) instead of being stuck at a dead end.
5. **Demo conversation back-link** (`conversation.html`): Back link now resolves to `/demo` when `isDemo=true`, not `/threads`. Users navigating demo conversations now return to the demo list, not the (potentially empty) app inbox.

**Issues flagged (INTERNAL_TODO.md [UX]):**
- Demo conv-body overflows viewport by ~40px in demo mode because `.conv-body { height: calc(100vh - 57px) }` doesn't account for the demo-banner height. Minor cosmetic issue; conversation still scrolls correctly. Suggest wrapping outer layout in a flex column or using `height: calc(100vh - 97px)` conditionally.

---

### Role 5 — Task Optimizer
Updated INTERNAL_TODO.md:
- Marked Demo mode [DONE]; archived to Done section (now 16 done items).
- Added 2 new [GROWTH][S] tasks from Role 3 in priority order (demo SEO, robots.txt) — inserted above the waitlist task since they're smaller and unblock SEO faster.
- Active task count: ~60 items. No newly blocked tasks. No duplicates.
- Next highest-priority no-prerequisite tasks: waitlist email capture [GROWTH][S] → SEO landing page [GROWTH][M] → privacy/terms stub pages [UX][S].

TODO_MASTER.md: 1 new [MARKETING] item added (demo URL promotion on social).

---

### Role 6 — Health Monitor
Security:
- **`DemoController @PathVariable int id`**: Spring converts path variable to `int`; non-integer paths return HTTP 400 before reaching the controller. Unknown valid integers handled by null check → `NoSuchElementException` → 404 via `GlobalExceptionHandler`. No injection risk.
- **`DemoService` demo bodies**: All HTML content is hardcoded string literals in the service class — not sourced from user input, email data, or the database. Zero XSS risk regardless of template rendering mode.
- **`isDemo` flag in `conversation.html`**: Boolean set by the controller; never sourced from request parameters or user input. `th:unless="${isDemo != null and isDemo}"` correctly guards the reply form.
- **`demo.html` header CTA**: `href="/threads"` is a hardcoded relative path; no URL injection.
- No new secrets or credentials introduced.

Performance:
- `DemoController` is the only route with **zero DB queries** — both `/demo` and `/demo/{id}` serve entirely in-memory data. Zero connection pool overhead, < 1ms response time (excluding view rendering).
- `DemoService.getConversation()` builds ~15 small Java objects per call; O(1), negligible overhead.
- Static `Participant` fields in `DemoService` are shared across requests (immutable display-only objects with no JPA session state); safe for concurrent use.

Code quality:
- `DemoService` is `@Service` with no injected dependencies — pure factory; correctly public (needed by `DemoController` in `web` package).
- `DemoController` is package-private — correctly scoped.
- `EmailThread.setMessageCount()` is `public`; justified because it's used by `DemoService` in another package. The setter name is explicit about its purpose.
- No dead code: all CSS classes added to `main.css` are referenced in the new/modified templates.

Legal:
- Demo content uses entirely fictional people, email addresses, and company names; no real data. No GDPR/privacy implications.
- No new dependencies; no new license risks.

## 2026-04-27 — Autonomous Run #10

### Role 1 — Feature Implementer
**Task completed**: Static pricing page at `/pricing` [GROWTH][S]

Files created/changed:
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/web/PricingController.java` — package-private `@Controller`; single `GET /pricing` mapping returning view `"pricing"`. No model attributes needed (fully static).
- `src/main/resources/templates/pricing.html` — full pricing page: sticky app header with "Pricing" and "Open App →" CTAs; hero section with accessible annual/monthly billing toggle (`role="group" aria-label="Billing period"`, `aria-pressed` on each toggle button); 4 plan cards (Free/$0, Personal/$9→$7.50/mo, Team/$29→$24/mo, Enterprise/$99→$83/mo) with feature matrix; FAQ grid (4 questions); footer with Privacy/ToS/Support links. Annual prices match APP_SPEC.md spec (2 months free = 10 × monthly). OG and meta-description tags added for social-share previews.
- `src/main/resources/static/css/main.css` — 180 lines of pricing CSS added: `.pricing-hero`, `.billing-toggle`/`.toggle-btn`/`.save-badge`, `.pricing-cards` (4-column responsive grid → 2-col at 900px → 1-col at 560px), `.plan-card`/`--featured` variant with blue border + "Most popular" badge, feature checklist, `.pricing-faq`/`.faq-grid`, `.pricing-footer`, `.brand-link` (removes text-decoration from brand `<a>` without inline style), `.nav-active`, `.btn-outline`. Dark mode not explicitly overridden — inherits CSS variables correctly.
- `src/main/resources/templates/threads.html` — added "Pricing" link to header nav (visible from the app, drives pricing page discovery for existing users considering upgrade).

Bug fixed during implementation: Personal plan annual note said "Billed $75/year" and `data-annual="$7"` — both wrong per spec. Corrected to "Billed $90/year" and `data-annual="$7.50"` ($9 × 10 months = $90/year).

Verified: `./mvnw test` → BUILD SUCCESS, 76 tests pass (up from 72).

**Income relevance**: The pricing page is the primary organic conversion touchpoint. Without it, any traffic from social shares, SEO, or word-of-mouth has no place to learn about plans and pricing before signing up. Adding it unblocks: (1) landing page cross-link, (2) in-app upgrade prompts linking to `/pricing`, (3) Product Hunt and directory listings that require a public pricing URL. The annual/monthly toggle primes users to consider the higher-LTV annual plan from first contact.

---

### Role 2 — Test Examiner
**Coverage added**: 4 new tests (76 total, up from 72)

Tests added:
- `PricingControllerTest` (1 test, new file):
  - `pricingPageReturns200AndPricingView` — `GET /pricing` → 200 OK, view name = `"pricing"`.
- `ThreadControllerTest` (1 new test added):
  - `listThreadsModelContainsTodayAndYesterdayAttributes` — verifies `today` and `yesterday` `LocalDate` objects are present in the model (added in Run #9 UX fix; was untested).
- `EmailThreadRepositoryTest` (2 new tests added):
  - `findByIdWithMessagesJoinFetchesMessagesAndSenders` — verifies the `findByIdWithMessages` JPQL query (N+1 fix added in Run #9) returns the thread with messages and sender loaded in a single join; asserts sender email is accessible without a separate query.
  - `findByIdWithMessagesReturnsEmptyForUnknownId` — verifies query returns `Optional.empty()` for a nonexistent ID.

Coverage status:
- `PricingController`: covered.
- `findByIdWithMessages` N+1 fix: now covered (was the only repository method with zero test coverage).
- `today`/`yesterday` model attributes: now covered.
- Income-critical paths still at zero coverage: Stripe webhook, user auth flows (not yet implemented).

No flaky or redundant tests. All 76 pass.

---

### Role 3 — Growth Strategist
5 new implementable tasks added to INTERNAL_TODO.md (not previously captured):

1. **Open Graph + meta description tags on all pages** [GROWTH][S] — `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:type`, and `<meta name="description">` on threads.html, conversation.html, error.html (pricing.html already done this run). Every social share generates a rich preview card; improves click-through from social posts. MEDIUM income impact. No prerequisites.
2. **Keyboard shortcut `?` help modal** [GROWTH][S] — Client-side JS modal listing all keyboard shortcuts when user presses `?`; power-user delight, increases retention and perceived quality. LOW-MEDIUM impact. No prerequisites.
3. **Sitemap.xml controller** [GROWTH][S] — `@Controller` returning XML with all public routes; submit to Google Search Console to accelerate indexing of pricing and demo pages. LOW impact. No prerequisites.
4. **Social proof section on pricing page** [GROWTH][S] — 2–3 short testimonials or "Trusted by X teams" placeholder section below plan cards; highest single-element conversion lever on a pricing page. MEDIUM income impact. No prerequisites for placeholder version.
5. **Pricing CTA → /waitlist fix** [UX][S] — Plan CTAs currently link to `/threads` (the app); new visitors land in an empty state with no context. Update to `/waitlist` once waitlist ships. Prerequisite: waitlist page.

2 new [MARKETING] items added to TODO_MASTER.md:
- Set up Plausible Analytics for pricing/landing pages (can't optimize conversion without measuring it).
- Update README and social profiles with `/pricing` URL once live.

---

### Role 4 — UX Auditor
Audited flows: pricing page (new), threads.html header nav update.

**Direct fixes applied:**
1. **Pricing page annual prices corrected**: Personal `data-annual="$7"` + "Billed $75/year" → `data-annual="$7.50"` + "Billed $90/year" (2 months free per spec = $9 × 10 = $90/year). Team and Enterprise were already correct.
2. **Accessible billing toggle**: Added `role="group" aria-label="Billing period"` to the toggle container; `aria-pressed="true/false"` on each button; JS `setPeriod()` now updates `aria-pressed` on toggle. Screen readers can now announce the selected billing period.
3. **Brand link inline style removed**: `<a class="brand" style="text-decoration:none;">` → `<a class="brand brand-link">` with `.brand-link { text-decoration: none; }` in CSS. Removes inline style override, keeps markup clean.
4. **OG and meta-description on pricing page**: Added `<meta name="description">`, `og:title`, `og:description`, `og:type` to pricing.html `<head>`. Visitors sharing the pricing URL will see a rich card on Twitter/LinkedIn/Slack instead of a bare URL.

**Issues flagged (INTERNAL_TODO.md [UX]):**
- Pricing CTA buttons link to `/threads` (app empty state), not `/waitlist` or `/demo`. Fix once waitlist or demo ships.
- Pricing `/pricing` FAQ and footer privacy/TOS links are `href="#"` dead ends. Fix: create `/privacy` and `/terms` stub pages. Added [LEGAL] item to TODO_MASTER.md.

---

### Role 5 — Task Optimizer
Updated INTERNAL_TODO.md:
- Removed pricing page task from active list (was marked DONE above).
- Archived to Done section: `[GROWTH][S] Static pricing page at /pricing`.
- Added 4 new [GROWTH][S] items from Role 3 in priority order (social proof first as highest conversion impact, then OG tags, then `?` shortcut, then sitemap).
- Added 2 new [UX][S] items from Role 4 (pricing CTA redirect fix, privacy/TOS stub pages).
- Active task count: ~58 items. No newly blocked tasks. No duplicates detected.
- All new items tagged [S]; no oversized tasks introduced.

---

### Role 6 — Health Monitor
Security:
- **`PricingController`**: No user input processed; `GET /pricing` maps to a static view. Zero attack surface. ✓
- **`pricing.html` JS**: `setPeriod()` reads from `el.dataset.monthly/annual` (hardcoded HTML attributes, not user input) and sets via `el.textContent` (not `innerHTML`) — no XSS risk. `aria-pressed` set via `setAttribute` with a string literal `'true'`/`'false'`. ✓
- **`billing-toggle` onclick**: Inline `onclick="setPeriod('monthly')"` uses a string literal argument, not user data; no injection vector. ✓
- **`mailto:sales@mailaim.app`**: Hardcoded address; not user-controlled. ✓
- No new secrets, credentials, or SQL in any added file. ✓

Performance:
- `PricingController.pricing()`: Returns a view name string; zero DB queries; O(1).
- Pricing CSS (~180 lines added): ~3 KB unminified, ~1.5 KB gzipped; negligible page weight.
- JS toggle: O(n) where n = number of plan cards (4); runs only on user click. Negligible.
- No new N+1 risks introduced.

Code quality:
- No dead code: all CSS classes are used in `pricing.html`; all template attributes are rendered.
- `PricingController` has no state, no dependencies — correctly package-private.
- Pricing page uses standard Thymeleaf `th:href="@{/css/main.css}"` for cache-busting — consistent with other templates. ✓

Legal:
- **Pricing page `href="#"` placeholders**: `/pricing` footer and FAQ link to Privacy Policy and ToS that do not exist. Added [LEGAL] item to TODO_MASTER.md. These must be real pages before accepting payments or EU users.
- **Annual pricing copy verified**: "$90/year (2 months free)" matches APP_SPEC.md. ✓
- No new dependencies added; no new license risks.

## 2026-04-27 — Autonomous Run #9

### Role 1 — Feature Implementer
**Task completed**: IMAP polling job (`@Scheduled`) behind a feature flag [CORE][M]

Files created/changed:
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/email/ImapPollingProperties.java` — `@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "app.imap")` POJO with host/port/username/password/ssl/folder and nested `Polling` (enabled, intervalMs) class; made `public` to allow `@EnableConfigurationProperties` reference from the main application class.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/email/ImapPollingJob.java` — `@Component @ConditionalOnProperty(name = "app.imap.polling.enabled", havingValue = "true")` job class; `@Scheduled(fixedDelayString = "${app.imap.polling.interval-ms:60000}")` on `poll()` method; connects to IMAP via `Session.getInstance()`, searches for `UNSEEN` messages with `FlagTerm`, calls `EmailImportService.importMessage()` per message, marks imported messages as `SEEN`, closes folder and store in `finally`. Per-message exception handling prevents one bad message from aborting the whole batch. Package-private `processMessages(Message[] messages)` extracted for unit testability.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/EmailMessengerApplication.java` — added `@EnableScheduling` and `@EnableConfigurationProperties(ImapPollingProperties.class)`.
- `src/main/resources/application.yml` — added `app.imap.*` block with default values in base config; added full env-var-backed `app.imap.*` override in `prod` profile (`IMAP_HOST`, `IMAP_PORT`, `IMAP_SSL`, `IMAP_FOLDER`, `IMAP_USER`, `IMAP_PASS`, `IMAP_POLLING_ENABLED`, `IMAP_POLLING_INTERVAL_MS`).
- `CLAUDE.md` — checked off "IMAP polling job" roadmap item.

Verified: `./mvnw test` → BUILD SUCCESS, 69 tests pass.

**Income relevance**: IMAP polling is the mechanism that actually gets emails into the app — without it, users must manually trigger imports (or use the not-yet-built mailbox settings page). This closes the last gap in the core data pipeline. The feature flag means it can be enabled in prod without code deploys once IMAP credentials are configured, supporting staged rollout.

---

### Role 2 — Test Examiner
**Coverage added**: 8 new tests (72 total, up from 63)

Tests added:
- `ImapPollingJobTest` (6 tests, new file):
  - `importedMessageIsMarkedSeen` — mock MimeMessage imported successfully → `setFlag(SEEN, true)` called
  - `alreadyImportedMessageIsNotMarkedSeen` — `importMessage` returns empty → `setFlag` never called
  - `exceptionOnOneMessageDoesNotAbortOthers` — first message throws → second message still processed
  - `nonMimeMessageIsSkipped` — non-MimeMessage instance → `importMessage` never called
  - `emptyMessageArrayIsHandledGracefully` — empty array → no interactions
  - `multipleMessagesAllImported` — 3 mock messages all imported and marked seen
- `ImapPollingEnabledContextTest` (2 tests, new file, `@SpringBootTest @TestPropertySource`):
  - `imapPollingJobBeanRegisteredWhenEnabled` — verifies bean exists in context when flag is true
  - `imapPollingPropertiesDefaultsAreCorrect` — verifies port=993, ssl=true, folder=INBOX, intervalMs=60000
- `EmailMessengerApplicationTests` (1 new test added):
  - `imapPollingJobNotRegisteredWhenPollingDisabled` — verifies bean absent in default context

Coverage status:
- `ImapPollingJob.processMessages()`: fully covered (import, skip, exception, non-MIME, empty, multi).
- `@ConditionalOnProperty` feature flag: verified both enabled (bean present) and disabled (bean absent).
- `ImapPollingProperties` defaults: covered.
- Income-critical paths still at zero coverage: Stripe webhook, user auth flows (not yet implemented).

---

### Role 3 — Growth Strategist
4 new implementable tasks added to INTERNAL_TODO.md (not previously captured):

1. **Waitlist email capture at /waitlist** [GROWTH][S] — Simple WaitlistEntry JPA entity + one-field form; HIGH income impact (lead gen before auth ships); no prerequisites. Fastest path to capturing demand.
2. **.mbox file import** [GROWTH][M] — Upload a Google Takeout / Thunderbird .mbox archive; bulk-imports all threads without IMAP credentials; HIGH income impact (zero-friction onboarding). No prerequisites.
3. **SSE live conversation refresh** [GROWTH][M] — Spring SseEmitter pushes new-message events to the open conversation page when ImapPollingJob imports emails; makes the app feel real-time. Prerequisite: IMAP polling (now done ✓).
4. **Basic thread search (LIKE query)** [GROWTH][S] — GET /threads?q= with LIKE query on subject and sender; faster to ship than tsvector; unblocks the search use case today. No prerequisites.

2 new [MARKETING] / [INFRASTRUCTURE] items added to TODO_MASTER.md:
- Record a 15-second screen recording of IMAP polling in action (highest-leverage visual demo asset).
- Set up Sentry error monitoring for production (IMAP polling failures are silent otherwise).

---

### Role 4 — UX Auditor
Audited flows: thread list page, conversation reply flow, error page, empty states.

**Direct fixes applied:**
1. **Thread list: humanized dates** (`ThreadController.java`, `threads.html`): Thread list now shows "Today" / "Yesterday" for threads updated in the last 2 days instead of "Jan 1, 2025". `LocalDate today` and `yesterday` added to model in `listThreads()`; Thymeleaf `th:with` + `equals()` used in template. Reduces date-parsing cognitive load.
2. **Thread list: dynamic count in section title** (`threads.html`): Section heading now shows "N Conversation(s)" (e.g. "5 Conversations") instead of static "Conversations" text.
3. **Empty state CTA fix** (`threads.html`): Changed `href="#"` to `href="/settings/mailboxes"` (at least gets a clean 404 error page with a back button, not a # noop). Updated CTA text from "Connect a mailbox" to "Connect Your Mailbox →" (action-oriented, directional arrow).
4. **Reply textarea accessibility** (`conversation.html`): Added `<label for="body" class="sr-only">Your reply</label>` and `id="body"` on the textarea — allows screen readers to announce the field and enables programmatic label association.
5. **Reply placeholder copy** (`conversation.html`): "Write a reply…" → "Write your reply here…" (slightly more inviting and directional).
6. **`.sr-only` CSS utility** (`main.css`): Added standard visually-hidden utility class for screen-reader-only content.

**Issues flagged (INTERNAL_TODO.md [UX]):**
- Thread list last-message preview still missing (requires schema change).
- "+ Add mailbox" link is a dead-end (still shows 404; recoverable via error page back button, but not a good experience).
- IMAP sync status indicator still missing; now note IMAP polling is done so this is unblocked.
- Mobile layout full pass still needed.

---

### Role 5 — Task Optimizer
Rewrote INTERNAL_TODO.md with full re-prioritization:
- Archived IMAP polling job from Active to Done (item 18 in Done section).
- Added 3 new [HEALTH] items (CSRF, rate-limiting, attachment @BatchSize).
- Grouped remaining 50 active tasks into priority sections: Health, No-Prerequisite Growth, UX, Auth-Gated Growth, Stripe-Gated Growth, Larger Post-Auth Features, Infrastructure.
- Tagged all tasks with prerequisites noted inline.
- Removed the "DONE" checkbox from the Active section (item moved to Done).
- Active task count: ~55 items across all sections; no truly blocked items (all dependencies are in-backlog).

---

### Role 6 — Health Monitor
Security:
- **`ImapPollingJob` credential handling**: `props.getPassword()` passed to `store.connect()` directly; not logged; configured via env vars; no credentials in code. ✓
- **`ImapPollingJob` log audit**: `log.info(...)` logs `username@host:port` on poll start — no password leaked. `log.error(...)` logs exception message on IMAP failure; no credential appears in exception stack trace. ✓
- **`Session.getInstance()` vs `getDefaultInstance()`**: Correctly uses `getInstance()` with a fresh `Properties` each poll call — avoids the singleton session bug where credentials or settings from one tenant leak to another. ✓
- **CSRF**: No Spring Security configured yet — no CSRF protection on reply form. Acceptable pre-auth. Tagged as [HEALTH][S] for when auth ships.
- **No new secrets or hardcoded credentials** introduced. ✓

Performance:
- **N+1 query FIX**: `ThreadViewService.getConversation()` was loading messages lazily (1 + N queries for senders). Added `findByIdWithMessages(@id)` JPQL query with `LEFT JOIN FETCH t.messages m LEFT JOIN FETCH m.sender` to `EmailThreadRepository`. `ThreadViewService` now calls this instead of `findById`. Conversation view now executes 1 query for thread+messages+senders vs. `2 + N` previously. For a 50-message thread: 52 queries → 1 query.
- **Attachment N+1**: `Message.attachments` is still `@OneToMany(LAZY)` — not part of the JOIN FETCH because adding a second bag fetch causes `MultipleBagFetchException`. Flagged as [HEALTH][S] in INTERNAL_TODO.md. Fix: `@BatchSize(size=50)` on `Message.attachments`. Deferred since most emails don't have attachments.

Code quality:
- `ImapPollingProperties.Polling` inner class getter/setter naming follows Java beans convention; Spring's `@ConfigurationProperties` binds `interval-ms` → `intervalMs` via relax binding. ✓
- No dead code introduced; `processMessages` is called from `poll()` and from tests. ✓

Legal:
- `com.sun.mail:jakarta.mail:2.0.1` (CDDL 1.1 + GPL v2 + Classpath Exception): Added [LEGAL] item to TODO_MASTER.md flagging the CDDL license and suggesting migration to Eclipse Angus Mail (EPL 2.0) for clarity before monetization.
- No new GPL or copyleft dependencies added this run. ✓

---

## 2026-04-26 — Autonomous Run #8

### Role 1 — Feature Implementer
**Task completed**: CSS polish — day separators, dark mode, refined bubbles, hover states [CORE][M]

Files changed:
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/service/BubbleRun.java` — added `date()` method (returns
  `LocalDate` of the first message's `sentAt`; null-safe: returns null for empty runs and null
  sentAt). Required to expose date info to the Thymeleaf template without inline list-access
  expressions.
- `src/main/resources/static/css/main.css` — 90 lines added:
  - **Dark mode** (`@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`): full variable override for `--bg`,
    `--surface`, `--border`, `--text`, `--text-muted`, `--brand`, `--brand-dark`; plus specific
    overrides for thread-item hover, reply textarea background, alert-success dark green, and
    bubble border opacity. GitHub-inspired dark palette (bg: #0d1117, surface: #161b22).
  - **Day separator**: `.day-separator` flex row with `::before`/`::after` hr lines and
    uppercase centered date label; 11px font, 0.05em letter-spacing.
  - **Bubble refinements**: added `border: 1px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.04)` + `transition: box-shadow`
    + `.bubble:hover { box-shadow: 0 2px 8px ... }` for tactile hover feedback.
  - **`.header-nav`/`.msg-count`**: replaced all inline styles in both templates with CSS classes.
  - **`.conv-header h1`**: added `flex: 1; min-width: 0` so long subjects ellipsis-truncate
    correctly when the new kbd-hint and msg-count siblings are present in the flex row.
  - **`.kb-focus`**: outline + background for keyboard-selected thread item (Role 4).
  - **`.kbd-hint`/`kbd`**: subtle shortcut label styling with bordered `<kbd>` chips.
- `src/main/resources/templates/conversation.html` — three changes:
  - `.bubble-run` now has `th:attr="data-date=..."` computed from `run.date()` for day separator
    JS; empty string when date is null (JS skips empty dates).
  - `<span style="...">` message count replaced with `<span class="msg-count">`.
  - Script block updated: IIFE runs day-separator insertion (parses `data-date`, inserts
    `.day-separator` divs between runs on different dates; labels "Today" / "Yesterday" /
    locale-formatted full date); then scrolls to bottom.
- `src/main/resources/templates/threads.html` — inline nav styles replaced with `.header-nav`
  CSS class.

Verified: `./mvnw test` → BUILD SUCCESS, 63 tests pass (up from 60).

**Income relevance**: Dark mode is a top-requested feature in productivity SaaS and is commonly
cited in App Store reviews as a conversion factor. Day separators make the chat-bubble metaphor
legible for long threads (without them, hours-long conversations look like chat from one sitting).
Keyboard shortcuts are used by power users before they upgrade — removing friction from the
"evaluating if I like this" phase directly improves conversion.

---

### Role 2 — Test Examiner
**Coverage added**: 3 new tests in `ConversationServiceTest` (63 total, up from 60)

Tests added:
- `bubbleRunDateReturnsLocalDateOfFirstMessage` — verifies `BubbleRun.date()` returns the
  `LocalDate` matching the first message's `sentAt`; uses a fixed timestamp `2025-06-15T09:30`.
- `bubbleRunDateIsNullWhenFirstMessageHasNullSentAt` — verifies `date()` returns null when the
  first message has no `sentAt` (defensive path for emails with missing `Date:` header).
- `separateRunsOnDifferentDaysHaveDifferentDates` — builds a two-run conversation with messages
  on 2025-06-15 and 2025-06-16 from different senders; verifies the two runs report different dates
  (prerequisite invariant for the day-separator logic).

Coverage status:
- `BubbleRun.date()`: fully covered (normal case, null sentAt, multi-run date comparison).
- Day separator JS: client-side; no unit test added (not a Java path).
- Keyboard shortcut JS: client-side; no unit test added.
- Income-critical paths still at zero coverage (unchanged from prior runs):
  - Stripe webhook handler
  - User authentication flows
  - IMAP polling job

---

### Role 3 — Growth Strategist
Identified 6 new implementable growth tasks not previously captured:

1. **Pricing page at /pricing** [GROWTH][S] — Static plan comparison table with feature matrix
   and CTA buttons; no auth required; prerequisite for organic conversion from landing page.
   HIGH income impact.
2. **14-day free trial on Personal tier** [GROWTH][S] — Set `trial_period_days=14` on the Stripe
   Personal plan price; no credit card at signup; highest single-lever SaaS conversion mechanism.
   HIGH income impact. Prerequisite: Stripe billing.
3. **PWA web app manifest** [GROWTH][S] — `manifest.json` + `apple-touch-icon`; users who install
   the PWA have 3× higher 30-day retention than browser-only users. MEDIUM income impact.
4. **Thread archiving** [GROWTH][S] — "Archive" action per thread; archived threads hidden from
   main list; separate /archived route. GTD workflow essential for power users. MEDIUM income
   impact. Prerequisite: user auth.
5. **Conversation pinning** [GROWTH][S] — Pin up to 3 threads to top of list; per-user state;
   drives team plan upgrade. MEDIUM income impact. Prerequisite: user auth.

Added 1 [MARKETING] item to TODO_MASTER.md:
- Transactional email provider (Postmark/SendGrid/Resend) with 3-email welcome sequence (day 0,
  3, 7). Highest ROI re-engagement mechanism for early SaaS.

---

### Role 4 — UX Auditor
Audited flows: thread list page, conversation view header + reply flow.

**Direct fixes applied:**
1. **Keyboard shortcuts — thread list** (`threads.html`): `j`/`k` navigate up/down through threads
   with a `.kb-focus` blue outline indicator; `Enter` opens the focused thread. IIFE guards against
   firing when a form input has focus; `metaKey`/`ctrlKey`/`altKey` modifier check prevents
   conflicts with OS shortcuts.
2. **Keyboard shortcuts — conversation** (`conversation.html`): `r` focuses the reply textarea
   and smooth-scrolls it into view; `Escape` blurs the textarea. Guard prevents `r` from firing
   while already in the textarea.
3. **Keyboard shortcut hints** (both templates): added a `<span class="kbd-hint">` in the header
   nav showing `[j] [k] navigate · [Enter] open` (thread list) and `[r] reply · [Esc] cancel`
   (conversation). Styled as subtle muted-color text with bordered `<kbd>` chips — discoverable
   without being noisy.
4. **Inline style cleanup** — removed all inline `style="..."` attributes from both templates;
   replaced with CSS classes `.header-nav`, `.msg-count`. HTML is now style-free.
5. **`conv-header h1` flex fix** — added `flex: 1; min-width: 0` so the subject heading properly
   truncates with ellipsis when kbd-hint and msg-count siblings narrow the available space.

**Issues still open (INTERNAL_TODO.md [UX]):**
- `+ Add mailbox` is a dead-end until mailbox settings page ships (requires user auth first).
- Thread list last-message-body preview missing.
- IMAP sync status indicator missing.
- Mobile layout full pass still needed.

---

### Role 5 — Task Optimizer
Updated INTERNAL_TODO.md:
- Archived 2 newly completed tasks to Done section:
  - [CORE][M] CSS polish → Done
  - [UX][S] Keyboard shortcuts → Done
  - Done section now has 19 items
- Added 5 new [GROWTH][S] tasks from Role 3 in priority order (pricing page first as it has
  no prerequisites; Stripe trial next; PWA manifest; archiving; pinning)
- Added 1 [MARKETING] item to TODO_MASTER.md (transactional email sequence)
- Active task count: 50 tasks (1 Core, 36 Growth, 4 UX, 3 Infra)
- No blocked tasks

---

### Role 6 — Health Monitor
Security:
- **`BubbleRun.date()` injection analysis**: `data-date` value written by Thymeleaf via
  `#temporals.format(LocalDate, 'yyyy-MM-dd')` produces only `\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}` output —
  no HTML injection possible regardless of input email date headers. ✓
- **`sep.innerHTML` in day separator JS**: `formatDateLabel(iso)` constructs output from a JS
  `Date` object via `toLocaleDateString()` — output is browser-computed text from a parsed date,
  not from any user-supplied string; cannot contain injected HTML. ✓
- **Keyboard shortcut JS**: reads only `e.key` (keyboard event property) and calls `click()` /
  `focus()` on pre-existing DOM elements. No user string reaches the DOM. ✓
- No new server-side security risks; all new code is either a pure Java method or client-side JS.

Performance:
- `BubbleRun.date()` is O(1): reads `messages.get(0)` then calls `.toLocalDate()`.
- Day separator IIFE: O(n) scan of `.bubble-run` elements; runs once on page load; negligible.
- CSS additions: ~90 lines; minified would be ~1.5 KB additional; negligible page weight.
- `flex: 1; min-width: 0` on h1: pure layout property; no layout-thrashing risk.

Code quality:
- `BubbleRun.date()` is null-safe at both the list-empty and null-sentAt levels. ✓
- JS uses `var` (not `const`/`let`) for IE11 compat fallback in the conversation template — minor,
  but consistent with the existing scroll script which used `const`. Updated to `const`/`let` where
  the IIFE uses them; outer functions use `var` for broadest compat. Acceptable.
- No inline styles remain in either template. Clean separation of style and markup. ✓
- No dead code: `formatDateLabel` is called in the day-separator IIFE.

Dependencies:
- No new dependencies added this run.
- jsoup 1.17.2 still current. Spring Boot 3.5.14 still current.

Legal:
- No new legal risks introduced.
- All prior [LEGAL] items in TODO_MASTER.md remain outstanding.

---

## 2026-04-26 — Autonomous Run #7

### Role 1 — Feature Implementer
**Task completed**: Thymeleaf templates — thread list, conversation view with chat bubbles, reply form [CORE][L]

Files created/changed:
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/web/ReplyForm.java` — package-private JavaBeans form object
  with `@NotBlank` + `@Size(max=100,000)` on the `body` field; used by `@Valid @ModelAttribute`
  in the reply POST handler.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/web/ThreadViewService.java` — package-private `@Service`;
  `@Transactional(readOnly=true)` method `getConversation(long threadId)` that loads `EmailThread`
  from the repository and calls `ConversationService.buildConversation()` within a single
  transaction (prevents `LazyInitializationException` from `thread.getMessages()` with
  `open-in-view=false`).
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/service/ReplyService.java` — public `@Service`;
  `sendReply(long threadId, String subject, String body)` loads the last message from the thread,
  constructs a `MimeMessage` via `MimeMessageHelper` (sets From, To, Subject, In-Reply-To,
  References headers), and sends via `JavaMailSender`. Throws `MailPreparationException` on
  `MessagingException`; `MailSendException` propagates from `mailSender.send()`. Both are caught
  by `GlobalExceptionHandler` (502 → friendly error page).
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/web/ThreadController.java` — package-private `@Controller`:
  - `GET /` → redirect to `/threads`
  - `GET /threads?page=N` → paginates `EmailThreadRepository.findAllByOrderByUpdatedAtDesc`,
    clamps negative page numbers to 0, adds `threads` (Page) to model, returns `"threads"` view.
  - `GET /threads/{id}` → loads `Conversation` via `ThreadViewService`, adds `replyForm` to
    model, returns `"conversation"` view.
  - `POST /threads/{id}/reply` → validates `ReplyForm`, shows validation errors inline if
    invalid, calls `ReplyService.sendReply`, redirects with flash `successMessage` on success.
- `src/main/resources/templates/threads.html` — Thymeleaf thread list: brand header with
  "+ Add mailbox" nav link, paginated thread list with subject/count/date per row, empty state
  card with CTA, pagination prev/next links.
- `src/main/resources/templates/conversation.html` — Thymeleaf conversation view: sticky back
  + subject header with message count badge, scrollable bubble area (auto-scrolls to bottom on
  load), BubbleRun avatar+sender+messages structure, `th:utext` for pre-sanitized HTML bodies
  (with explanatory comment), reply form with inline validation error display and success flash,
  "Send Reply" as primary CTA.
- `src/main/resources/static/css/main.css` — 250-line IM-look CSS: CSS custom properties,
  thread list items, chat bubble styling (4px/16px radius, box-shadow), avatar circles, sticky
  reply area, focus ring on textarea, mobile breakpoint at 640px.

Bug fixed during implementation: `EmailThread` has `getId()` not `id()` — template originally
used `${conversation.thread().id()}` which would throw `SpelEvaluationException`; corrected to
`${conversation.thread().id}` (property access).

Verified: `./mvnw test` → BUILD SUCCESS, 60 tests pass (was 48).

**Income relevance**: The thread list and conversation view are the product's entire visible
surface area. Without templates, there is no product for users to see, no conversion funnel, and
no path to payment. This is the single most income-blocking task in the backlog and is now done.

---

### Role 2 — Test Examiner
**Coverage added**: 12 new tests across 2 new test classes (60 total, up from 48)

Files created:
- `src/test/java/com/emailmessenger/web/ThreadControllerTest.java` (8 tests):
  - `rootRedirectsToThreads` — GET / returns 302 to /threads
  - `listThreadsReturnsThreadsViewWithModel` — empty page → 200, view="threads", model has "threads"
  - `listThreadsNegativePageClampsToZero` — page=-5 → still returns 200 (no exception)
  - `viewConversationReturnsConversationView` — valid id → 200, view="conversation", has model attrs
  - `viewConversationWithUnknownIdReturns404` — getConversation throws NoSuchElementException → 404, view="error"
  - `replyWithEmptyBodyShowsValidationErrorAndConversationView` — empty body → 200, view="conversation",
    model has field errors on "body", ReplyService is never called
  - `replyWithValidBodyRedirectsWithSuccessFlash` — valid body → 302 to /threads/{id}
  - `replyWithUnknownThreadIdReturns404` — unknown id on error path → 404
  
  All tests use `MockMvcBuilders.standaloneSetup` with `InternalResourceViewResolver` (prefix
  "/WEB-INF/templates/", suffix ".html") to prevent circular view path error in standalone mode.
  `GlobalExceptionHandler` included via `.setControllerAdvice()`.

- `src/test/java/com/emailmessenger/service/ReplyServiceTest.java` (4 tests):
  - `sendReplyDoesNothingWhenThreadHasNoMessages` — empty thread → mailSender.send never called
  - `sendReplySendsMimeMessageToLastMessageSender` — verifies Subject = "Re: ...", To = last sender email
  - `sendReplyUsesLastMessageSenderWhenMultipleMessages` — picks last message's sender, not first
  - `sendReplyPropagatesMailSendExceptionOnFailure` — MailSendException propagates to controller

Income-critical paths now covered:
- Reply form validation (empty body blocked, no spam send)
- Reply service routing (last message sender, not arbitrary)
- 404 handling for missing threads on all paths

Still zero coverage (code not written yet):
- Stripe webhook handler and subscription state
- User authentication flows
- IMAP polling job

---

### Role 3 — Growth Strategist
Identified 5 new implementable growth opportunities not previously captured:

1. **Custom SMTP/from-address per user** [GROWTH][S] — Without this, all outgoing replies
   come from the app's noreply address, which is useless in production. Per-user SMTP config is
   a prerequisite for the reply feature being actually valuable post-auth. HIGH income impact.
   Prerequisite: user auth.
2. **AI-generated thread summary** [GROWTH][M] — One-sentence summary per thread shown in
   thread list; Claude API (already available); Personal+ gate; strong differentiator vs every
   other email client. HIGH income impact. Prerequisite: auth + ANTHROPIC_API_KEY env var.
3. **Reply signature** [GROWTH][S] — Per-user configurable signature appended to all replies;
   increases reply adoption by making the app feel production-ready; Personal+ gate. MEDIUM
   income impact. Prerequisite: user auth.
4. **Outbound webhook trigger** [GROWTH][S] — POST to a user-configured URL on new message
   arrival; enables Zapier/Make integrations without a full API; Team plan gate. MEDIUM income
   impact. Prerequisite: IMAP polling.
5. **"Copy conversation as Markdown"** [GROWTH][S] — One-click copy of full thread as Markdown
   to clipboard; useful for pasting into Notion/Slack/docs; zero-friction share touchpoint.
   MEDIUM income impact.

Added 2 [MARKETING] items to TODO_MASTER.md:
- 15-second GIF/screen recording of email → chat bubble transform for social distribution.
- Configure ANTHROPIC_API_KEY env var once AI summary feature ships.

---

### Role 4 — UX Auditor
Audited flows: Landing `/` → thread list, thread list → conversation view, reply form submit.

**Direct fixes applied:**
1. **App header navigation** — Added "+ Add mailbox" link to threads.html header. Previously
   there was no navigation at all; new users had no affordance to find where to connect a
   mailbox. The link points to `/settings/mailboxes` (not yet built, tracked in UX TODO).
2. **Conversation page title truncation** — Capped `<title>` to 57 chars + ellipsis to prevent
   ugly/truncated browser tab labels from long email subjects.
3. **Message count in conversation header** — Added "N message(s)" count badge to the right
   of the thread subject in the conversation header; helps users orient without scrolling.

**Issues flagged (added to INTERNAL_TODO.md [UX]):**
- Thread list: no last-message preview text below subject — users can't identify threads
  at a glance; requires denormalizing preview into email_threads table or a query join.
- Keyboard shortcuts (j/k/r/Esc) not implemented; essential for power user adoption.
- "+ Add mailbox" link is a dead-end until mailbox settings page is built.
- IMAP sync status indicator still missing (carried from prior runs).
- Mobile layout pass needed (basic responsive CSS exists, not fully tested).

### Role 5 — Task Optimizer
Rewrote INTERNAL_TODO.md:
- Archived 8 newly completed tasks:
  - [CORE][L] Thymeleaf templates → Done
  - [HEALTH][S] Input validation (ReplyForm) → Done
  - [UX][S] Thread list empty state → Done
  - [UX][S] Conversation view empty state → Done
  - [UX][S] Reply button visual prominence → Done
  - [UX][S] Bubble body th:utext rendering → Done
  - Done section now has 19 items
- Added 5 new [GROWTH] tasks from Role 3 in priority order
- Added 3 new [UX] tasks from Role 4 (2 carried forward + 1 new header nav item)
- Removed [HEALTH][S] "input validation" from active — done via ReplyForm @Valid
- CSS task description updated to note basic CSS is in place; remaining work is polish
- Active task count: 46 tasks (2 Core, 35 Growth, 5 UX, 3 Infra)
- No blocked tasks (input validation prerequisite now resolved)

---

### Role 6 — Health Monitor
Security:
- `ThreadController.reply` validates `ReplyForm` with `@Valid` + `BindingResult` before calling
  `ReplyService.sendReply` — no unchecked user input reaches the mail layer. Input validation
  constraint is now enforced at the web boundary.
- `ReplyService.sendReply` uses `MimeMessageHelper.setText(body, false)` — `false` means
  plain text, no HTML injection risk in outgoing reply body.
- `ReplyService.fromAddress` is initialized to `"noreply@mailaim.app"` — a defined fallback
  prevents null `setFrom()` call which would result in a malformed SMTP envelope.
- No user input is passed to `setFrom()` — "from" address is app-controlled only.

Performance:
- `ThreadViewService.getConversation` is `@Transactional(readOnly=true)` — read-only hint
  signals Hibernate to skip dirty checking; no write locks acquired.
- `ThreadController.listThreads` uses `PageRequest.of(page, 20)` — paginated; never loads all
  threads. Free tier users with 500 threads: max 20 per request.
- `ReplyService.sendReply` does one `findByThreadIdOrderBySentAtAsc` query — O(n) in thread
  message count. For typical threads (<100 messages) this is negligible.

Code quality:
- `ThreadViewService` is package-private to `web` — correctly scoped; not exposed beyond
  the web package boundary.
- `ReplyForm` is package-private — correctly scoped; only used by `ThreadController`.
- No field `@Autowired` in any new class; all constructor injection.
- `ReplyService.sendReply` is `@Transactional(readOnly=true)` to load sender data safely.

Dependencies:
- No new dependencies added this run. All mail functionality uses `spring-boot-starter-mail`
  and `jakarta.mail` already in pom.xml.

Legal:
- No new legal risks introduced.
- All prior [LEGAL] items in TODO_MASTER.md remain outstanding.

## 2026-04-26 — Autonomous Run #6

### Role 1 — Feature Implementer
**Tasks completed**: EmailImportException + GlobalExceptionHandler + error.html [HEALTH][S] × 2

Files created/changed:
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/email/EmailImportException.java` — package-private unchecked
  exception wrapping `MessagingException` / `IOException` from the mail parse layer. Callers
  no longer leak Jakarta Mail types across package boundaries.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/email/EmailImportService.java` — `importMessage()` signature
  changed from `throws MessagingException, IOException` to unchecked. Body wrapped in
  `try/catch (MessagingException | IOException e)` → `throw new EmailImportException(...)`.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/web/GlobalExceptionHandler.java` — `@ControllerAdvice` with
  five handlers: `NoResourceFoundException` (404), `NoSuchElementException` (404),
  `MailException | EmailImportException` (502), `DataIntegrityViolationException` (409),
  `Exception` (500). All handlers set the HTTP status via `HttpServletResponse.setStatus()`,
  populate `status` and `message` model attributes, and return view name `"error"`. SLF4J
  logger logs WARN for mail/conflict errors, ERROR with full stack trace for unhandled exceptions.
- `src/main/resources/templates/error.html` — Thymeleaf error page: centered card, status code
  in red, context-sensitive heading (different for 404 / 50x / 409), plain-English message
  attribute, "Back to MailIM" button, support email link. Mobile-responsive. Replaces Spring
  Whitelabel error page.
- `src/main/resources/application.yml` — added `server.error.whitelabel.enabled: false` in dev
  profile so Spring's built-in Whitelabel page can never appear.

Verified: `./mvnw test` → BUILD SUCCESS, 48 tests pass.

**Income relevance**: Users previously saw raw Spring Whitelabel error pages on any unhandled
exception, which undermines trust. Professional error pages with actionable messages reduce
abandonment. Hiding checked exceptions behind `EmailImportException` prevents accidental exception
leakage into future web controllers (which would result in 500 pages for preventable errors).

---

### Role 2 — Test Examiner
**Coverage added**: 4 new tests in GlobalExceptionHandlerTest

File created: `src/test/java/com/emailmessenger/web/GlobalExceptionHandlerTest.java`
- Uses `MockMvcBuilders.standaloneSetup()` with a package-private inner `ThrowingController` —
  no `@SpringBootTest` overhead; fast and isolated.
- `mailExceptionReturns502WithErrorView` — `MailSendException` → 502, view=error, model.status=502
- `noSuchElementReturns404WithErrorView` — `NoSuchElementException` → 404, view=error, model.status=404
- `dataIntegrityViolationReturns409WithErrorView` — `DataIntegrityViolationException` → 409
- `unhandledExceptionReturns500WithErrorView` — `RuntimeException` → 500, view=error, model.status=500

Total test count: 48 (up from 44). 0 failures.

Income-critical paths still at zero coverage (code not yet written):
- Stripe webhook handler and subscription state
- User authentication flows
- IMAP polling job
- Thymeleaf thread list / conversation templates

---

### Role 3 — Growth Strategist
Identified 4 new implementable growth opportunities not previously captured:

1. **Annual/monthly billing toggle** [GROWTH][S] — Show a toggle on the pricing/plan-selection page
   switching between monthly and annual pricing with a "Save 16%" label. Annual = 2× LTV per
   conversion. HIGH income impact. Prerequisite: Stripe billing task.
2. **REST API for Personal+ tier** [GROWTH][M] — JSON API exposing thread list, message retrieval,
   and reply sending; enables Zapier/Make integrations; strong upsell lever for developer users.
   HIGH income impact.
3. **"Sent via MailIM" branding footer** [GROWTH][S] — Append "Sent via MailIM [try free]" link
   to outgoing email replies for Free-tier users only. Each sent email distributes the product.
   Disabled for Personal+. MEDIUM income impact.
4. **Public roadmap at /roadmap** [GROWTH][S] — Static page listing upcoming features; shows
   the product is actively developed; generates shareability. MEDIUM income impact.

Added 2 [MARKETING] items to TODO_MASTER.md:
- Affiliate program via Rewardful/PartnerStack (30% recurring commission)
- NPS survey at day 30 (Delighted/Typeform) for review velocity and churn prevention

---

### Role 4 — UX Auditor
Templates still do not exist; no live user flow beyond error pages.

**Direct fix: error.html UX improvements**
- Added context-sensitive h1 heading that varies by status: "Page not found" (404), "Mail server
  unreachable" (502/503), "Conflict saving data" (409), "Something went wrong" (all others).
  Users immediately understand the failure category without reading the paragraph.
- Added "Still stuck? Contact support" link below the back-to-home button with `mailto:support@mailaim.app`.
  Previously there was no recovery path if the user's issue was not solved by going home.
- Mobile responsive: cards shrink to 16px side padding on narrow viewports; font sizes scale.

No new UX items flagged (previously flagged UX backlog remains unchanged — all depend on
Thymeleaf templates which are the next CORE task).

---

### Role 5 — Task Optimizer
Rewrote INTERNAL_TODO.md:
- Archived 2 newly completed HEALTH tasks:
  - [HEALTH][S] EmailImportException wrapping → Done section
  - [HEALTH][S] GlobalExceptionHandler + error.html → Done section
  - Done section now has 11 items
- Added 4 new [GROWTH] tasks from Role 3 in priority order
- Remaining [HEALTH][S] input validation task moved to top; tagged with note that it is
  BLOCKED until web controllers exist (prerequisite: Thymeleaf templates task)
- Added 2 new [MARKETING] items to TODO_MASTER.md
- Active task count: 40 tasks (1 Health, 3 Core, 30 Growth, 7 UX, 3 Infra)
- No blocked tasks except input validation (labeled with prerequisite note, not BLOCKED tag
  since it's still workable next session after templates ship)

---

### Role 6 — Health Monitor
Security:
- **No exception details exposed to users**: all error messages in GlobalExceptionHandler are
  hardcoded safe strings; exception objects are logged server-side only. Zero information leakage.
- **EmailImportException wrapping**: stack traces from Jakarta Mail are now retained in the cause
  chain (logged at WARN/ERROR) but never surfaced to the HTTP response. Clean separation.
- **Logging added**: `log.warn()` for mail/conflict errors, `log.error(ex)` with full stack trace
  for unhandled exceptions — previously all exceptions were silently swallowed after this handler
  was set up. Production observability now restored.
- No new hardcoded credentials, no SQL, no user-controlled data in error messages.

Performance:
- GlobalExceptionHandler is a Spring singleton; no state; zero overhead on the happy path.
- EmailImportException construction is O(1); negligible impact.

Code quality:
- `mailError` handler's `Exception ex` parameter now used in the log statement — no dead parameters.
- SLF4J Logger follows Spring Boot conventions (`LoggerFactory.getLogger(GlobalExceptionHandler.class)`).
- `EmailImportException` constructor is package-private — correctly scoped; only `EmailImportService`
  within the email package constructs it; `GlobalExceptionHandler` catches it by type only.

Dependencies:
- No new dependencies added this run.
- jsoup 1.17.2 still current; Spring Boot 3.5.14 still current.

Legal:
- No new legal risks introduced.
- All prior [LEGAL] items in TODO_MASTER.md remain outstanding.

## 2026-04-26 — Autonomous Run #5

### Role 1 — Feature Implementer
**Task completed**: HTML email body XSS sanitization [HEALTH][M] — CRITICAL pre-launch blocker

Files changed:
- `pom.xml` — added `org.jsoup:jsoup:1.17.2` runtime dependency.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/service/ConversationService.java` — `buildBodyHtml`
  now passes the raw HTML email body through `Jsoup.clean(html, Safelist.relaxed())` before
  returning it. This strips `<script>` tags, inline event handlers (`onclick`, `onerror`, etc.),
  `javascript:` protocol hrefs, `<iframe>`, and any other dangerous construct that malicious
  senders embed in HTML email bodies. Safe elements — `<p>`, `<b>`, `<strong>`, `<em>`, `<a>`,
  `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`, `<blockquote>`, `<code>`, `<pre>` — are preserved unchanged.
  The plain-text path (renderMarkdown) was already safe via HTML-escaping; no change needed there.

Verified: `./mvnw test` → BUILD SUCCESS, 44 tests pass.

**Income relevance**: Closes the only CRITICAL security vulnerability identified since
project start. Without sanitization, any HTML email with a `<script>` tag would execute
in every subscriber's browser. Shipping this unresolved would be a liability that could
kill the business on first security disclosure.

---

### Role 2 — Test Examiner
**Coverage added**: 4 new XSS sanitization tests in ConversationServiceTest

Tests added:
- `scriptTagsStrippedFromHtmlBody` — verifies `<script>alert('xss')</script>` is removed
  and safe content is preserved.
- `inlineEventHandlersStrippedFromHtmlBody` — verifies `onclick` is stripped from `<a>` tags.
- `javascriptLinksStrippedFromHtmlBody` — verifies `javascript:void(0)` href is removed.
- `safeHtmlElementsPreservedAfterSanitization` — verifies `<strong>` and `<em>` survive.

Also updated `htmlBodyPassesThroughWithoutTransform` to use `contains()` assertions
instead of `isEqualTo()` to be robust against jsoup output normalization differences.

Total test count: 44 (up from 40). 0 failures.

Income-critical paths still at zero coverage (code not yet written):
- Stripe webhook handler and subscription state
- User authentication flows
- IMAP polling job
- Thymeleaf template rendering

---

### Role 3 — Growth Strategist
Identified 4 new implementable growth opportunities not previously captured:

1. **Stripe customer portal integration** [GROWTH][S] — Stripe self-service portal for plan
   upgrades, downgrades, cancellations, and invoice downloads. Reduces support overhead and
   churn from users who can't find the cancel button. HIGH income impact (direct retention
   mechanism). Prerequisite: Stripe billing task.
2. **In-app upgrade preview of locked features** [GROWTH][S] — Show blurred/disabled previews
   of Team-tier features (Slack webhook, full-text search) with an "Upgrade to unlock" CTA.
   Direct upgrade-conversion trigger visible to every Personal-tier user. HIGH income impact.
3. **Send-later scheduling for replies** [GROWTH][M] — Schedule an email reply to send at a
   future time; critical for remote workers across time zones. Personal/Team plan gate. HIGH
   income impact (differentiation from standard email clients).
4. **Thread snooze** [GROWTH][S] — Snooze a thread to re-surface at a user-set time; reduces
   inbox anxiety and drives daily re-engagement. MEDIUM income impact.

Added 1 [MARKETING] item to TODO_MASTER.md:
- AppSumo lifetime deal: immediate lump-sum revenue + organic reviews.

---

### Role 4 — UX Auditor
Templates still do not exist; no live user flows to walk. One UX task completed directly in code:

**Direct fix: Participant.initials() helper** [UX][S]
- Added `initials()` method to `Participant` entity: "Alice Bob"→"AB", "alice@test.com"→"A",
  "Charlie"→"C". This is the prerequisite for the avatar rendering planned in templates — without
  it, the template author would have to inline the initials logic in Thymeleaf expressions.
- Method is a pure string function with no JPA/persistence side effects; safe to call anywhere.

Updated UX note in INTERNAL_TODO.md: "[UX][S] Bubble body HTML rendering — use th:utext"
now explicitly states that the value is "pre-rendered and already sanitized HTML" (now that
the sanitization fix is in place), so template authors don't need to add their own safeguards.

No structural UX issues possible to flag without live templates; existing UX task list in
INTERNAL_TODO.md remains accurate.

---

### Role 5 — Task Optimizer
Rewrote INTERNAL_TODO.md:
- Archived 2 newly completed tasks:
  - [HEALTH][M] HTML sanitization → Done section
  - [UX][S] Participant initials utility → Done section
  - Done section now has 9 items
- Added 4 new [GROWTH] tasks from Role 3 in priority order
- Added 1 new AppSumo [MARKETING] item to TODO_MASTER.md
- Removed duplicate mention of initials in Gravatar task (notes helper already exists)
- TODO_MASTER.md [CRITICAL] XSS item tagged [LIKELY DONE - verify] since code fix is complete
- Active task count: 40 tasks across Health (3), Core (3), Growth (26), UX (8), Infra (3) sections
- All tasks remain [S/M/L] tagged; no vague or oversized tasks
- No blocked tasks

---

### Role 6 — Health Monitor
Security:
- **XSS vector closed**: jsoup 1.17.2 `Safelist.relaxed()` sanitization is now active in
  production code path. Verified by 4 new tests covering script injection, event handler
  injection, javascript: protocol abuse, and safe-element preservation.
- jsoup 1.17.2 — no known CVEs; widely deployed in production Spring Boot applications.
  Consider upgrading to 1.18.1 when convenient (no security driver; minor API improvements).
- No new hardcoded credentials in any file added this run.
- `initials()` in Participant is pure string manipulation — no SQL, no user input reaching
  any persistence layer, no XSS risk.

Performance:
- `Jsoup.clean()` is O(n) in HTML size. For typical email bodies (< 100 KB), the overhead
  is negligible (sub-millisecond). No caching needed.
- No new N+1 query risks introduced.

Code quality:
- Comment in `buildBodyHtml` explains WHY sanitization is done (malicious sender context) —
  non-obvious to a future reader; justified. All other new code is self-explanatory.
- `initials()` follows the project convention (no unnecessary comments, no field `@Autowired`).
- Dead code check: all modified code paths are exercised by tests.

Dependencies:
- jsoup 1.17.2 added (Apache 2.0 license — compatible with commercial SaaS use, no copyleft risk).
- Spring Boot 3.5.14 still current; no new CVEs flagged.

Legal:
- jsoup is Apache 2.0 licensed — no copyleft constraint; safe for commercial closed-source use.
- All prior [LEGAL] items in TODO_MASTER.md remain outstanding (Privacy Policy, ToS, Refund
  Policy, Cookie consent) — none were addressed this run (require Master action).

## 2026-04-26 — Autonomous Run #4

### Role 1 — Feature Implementer
**Task completed**: IM transform — quoted-reply stripping, same-sender bubble grouping, markdown rendering

Files created:
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/service/IMTransformService.java` — package-private `@Service`:
  - `stripQuotes(String)`: line-by-line parser; detects "On ... wrote:" attribution (including
    wrapped multi-line variants), Outlook "-----Original Message-----" divider, and `> ` prefixed
    quote lines; cuts everything from the first attribution/divider onwards; collapses 3+ blank
    lines to 2; strips surrounding whitespace.
  - `renderMarkdown(String)`: HTML-escapes input first (prevents XSS in plain-text path), then
    applies regex transforms for **bold**, *italic*, `code`, and URL auto-linking; wraps in `<p>`
    tags at blank-line boundaries, single newlines become `<br>`.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/service/ConversationService.java` — public `@Service`:
  - `buildConversation(EmailThread)` — iterates thread's messages (already `@OrderBy sentAt ASC`),
    groups consecutive same-sender messages into `BubbleRun` instances (compared by email address,
    not DB ID, so works on unsaved entities in tests), returns an immutable `Conversation`.
  - `buildBodyHtml(Message)` — prefers `bodyHtml` from the email if present; otherwise strips
    quotes then renders plain text as markdown HTML.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/service/BubbleMessage.java` — package-private record:
  `(messageId, bodyHtml, sentAt, attachments)`.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/service/BubbleRun.java` — package-private record:
  `(sender, messages)`.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/service/Conversation.java` — public record:
  `(thread, runs)`.

Verified: `./mvnw test` → BUILD SUCCESS, 40 tests pass.

**Income relevance**: The IM transform is the product's primary value proposition — without it,
threads display as raw email walls of text, not chat bubbles. This layer directly gates all
UI work that drives conversion.

---

### Role 2 — Test Examiner
**Coverage added**: 23 new tests (14 IMTransformService + 8 ConversationService + 1 BCC import)

Files added:
- `src/test/java/com/emailmessenger/service/IMTransformServiceTest.java` (14 tests):
  - null body, non-quoted content preserved, `>` line removal, Gmail "On ... wrote:" removal,
    wrapped 2-line attribution, Outlook divider, blank-line collapsing, bold, italic, inline
    code, URL auto-link, paragraph wrapping, HTML char escaping.
- `src/test/java/com/emailmessenger/service/ConversationServiceTest.java` (8 tests):
  - empty thread, single message, same-sender grouping, different-sender splitting,
    mixed group counts, plain-to-HTML body transform, HTML body passthrough, quoted-reply stripping.
- Added `bccRecipientsAreCaptured` test to `EmailImportServiceTest` — BCC path was exercised
  in code but had zero test coverage.

Total test count: 40 (up from 17). No failures. No flaky tests.

Income-critical paths still at zero coverage (code not written yet):
- Stripe webhook handler and subscription state
- User authentication flows
- IMAP polling job
- Thymeleaf template rendering

---

### Role 3 — Growth Strategist
Added 4 new growth tasks to INTERNAL_TODO.md not previously captured:
1. **Demo mode** [GROWTH][S] — /demo route with pre-seeded sample threads; visitors experience
   the IM view without signing up; removes top-of-funnel uncertainty. HIGH income impact.
2. **Email forwarding address** [GROWTH][M] — unique @mailaim.app address per user; forwarded
   emails auto-import; avoids IMAP credential friction entirely. HIGH income impact.
3. **EML file upload** [GROWTH][S] — upload a .eml file to seed threads instantly; zero-friction
   demo path. MEDIUM income impact.
4. **Thread labels/tags** [GROWTH][M] — user-defined labels; Team plan feature gate. MEDIUM income
   impact; drives Personal → Team upgrade.

Added 2 [MARKETING] items to TODO_MASTER.md:
- Loom/YouTube demo video: highest-leverage single landing-page conversion asset.
- Chrome/Firefox extension: "Open in MailIM" button in Gmail = viral distribution loop.

---

### Role 4 — UX Auditor
Templates still do not exist; no live user flow to walk. Two new UX issues flagged from
the new service layer:
1. **Participant initials utility** [UX][S] — no method exists to compute avatar initials from
   displayName; template work will be blocked without this helper.
2. **th:utext rendering note** [UX][S] — BubbleMessage.bodyHtml contains pre-rendered HTML;
   Thymeleaf must use th:utext not th:text; flagged for the template author to avoid a subtle
   "shows raw HTML tags" bug.

---

### Role 5 — Task Optimizer
Rewrote INTERNAL_TODO.md:
- Archived 1 new completed task (IM transform) → Done section now has 7 items
- Promoted [HEALTH][M] HTML sanitization to a new "Health / Security (pre-launch blockers)"
  section at the top — it must be resolved before templates ship
- Added 4 new [GROWTH] and 2 new [UX] tasks from this run
- Consolidated growth tasks in priority order: auth/billing/limits first, then
  onboarding/SEO/virality, then engagement, then infrastructure
- Verified no duplicates across 37 active tasks
- All tasks tagged [S/M/L]

---

### Role 6 — Health Monitor
Security (one critical finding):
- **XSS in HTML email bodies** [CRITICAL]: `ConversationService.buildBodyHtml` returns
  `msg.getBodyHtml()` directly without sanitization. When Thymeleaf renders this with `th:utext`,
  any `<script>`, event handler, or iframe in an incoming email executes in the user's browser.
  Fix: add jsoup to pom.xml and call `Jsoup.clean(bodyHtml, Safelist.relaxed())` before returning.
  Added [CRITICAL] note to TODO_MASTER.md and [HEALTH][M] task to INTERNAL_TODO.md.
- The plain-text path (`renderMarkdown`) is safe: HTML is escaped before any regex transformation,
  so no injection is possible through the markdown renderer.

Performance:
- `IMTransformService.stripQuotes` is O(n) in number of lines; no regex backtracking risk since
  all patterns are simple anchored or character-class patterns.
- `ConversationService.buildConversation` is O(n) in messages; produces `List.copyOf` snapshots —
  immutable and safe to cache.

Code quality:
- `IMTransformService` and view model records (`BubbleMessage`, `BubbleRun`) are package-private —
  correctly scoped; only `ConversationService` and `Conversation` are public.
- Constructor injection in `ConversationService`; no field `@Autowired`.
- No dead code. All 5 new files are exercised by tests.

Dependencies:
- No new runtime dependencies added this run. jsoup needed for the HTML sanitization fix (tracked).

Legal: no change from prior runs — all open [LEGAL] items in TODO_MASTER.md remain outstanding.

---

## 2026-04-26 — Autonomous Run #3

### Role 1 — Feature Implementer
**Task completed**: Email-import service — RFC 822 parsing + thread building

Files created:
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/email/ParsedEmail.java` — package-private record holding
  all parsed fields from a MimeMessage before DB operations: messageId, inReplyTo, references
  (List<String>), subject, from, to/cc/bcc recipients, bodyPlain, bodyHtml, attachments, sentAt.
  Two nested records: `AddressEntry(email, name)` and `AttachmentEntry(filename, mimeType, sizeBytes)`.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/email/MimeMessageParser.java` — package-private class that
  walks a `MimeMessage` tree: extracts RFC 5322 headers, recursively walks `multipart/*` to find
  `text/plain` / `text/html` parts, collects attachment metadata (filename, mimeType, size).
  Does NOT read attachment byte content — only metadata; blob_ref is wired separately.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/email/EmailImportService.java` — `@Service` with
  `@Transactional` import method:
  - Idempotent: skips if Message-ID already exists in the database.
  - Thread resolution: walks References list newest-first per RFC 5322, falls back to In-Reply-To,
    then rootMessageId lookup, then creates a new EmailThread.
  - `resolveParticipant()`: find-or-create Participant by normalised email address.
  - Attachment metadata captured; `blob_ref` is null until external storage is wired.
  - Save order: `messageRepo.save(message)` first so the subsequent `threadRepo.save(thread)`
    cascade-merges an already-managed entity (avoids double-INSERT unique constraint violation).

Bug found and fixed during test run: original code called `thread.addMessage(message)` +
`threadRepo.save(thread)` (which cascades ALL to the unsaved message entity, inserting it), then
called `messageRepo.save(message)` again — violating the `message_id_header` unique constraint.
Fix: save message first, then add to thread, then save thread.

Verified: `./mvnw test` → BUILD SUCCESS, 17 tests pass.

**Income relevance**: Email parsing and thread building are the core data pipeline. Without this,
no thread can ever appear in the UI — it is the prerequisite for all user-visible value.

---

### Role 2 — Test Examiner
**Coverage added**: 6 new tests in `EmailImportServiceTest` (17 total, up from 11)

File created: `src/test/java/com/emailmessenger/email/EmailImportServiceTest.java`
- `importCreatesThreadAndMessage` — verifies thread, message, sender, body, rootMessageId
- `replyViaInReplyToJoinsExistingThread` — verifies In-Reply-To links reply to parent thread; checks messageCount=2
- `replyViaReferencesJoinsExistingThread` — verifies References header thread linking
- `duplicateMessageIdIsSkipped` — verifies idempotency returns empty + only one DB row
- `senderParticipantIsDeduplicated` — verifies two messages from same address → 1 Participant
- `toAndCcRecipientsAreCaptured` — verifies RecipientType.TO (×2) and CC (×1) stored correctly

Tests use `@SpringBootTest @ActiveProfiles("dev") @Transactional` with H2; each test rolls back.
MimeMessage instances built in-process via `jakarta.mail.Session.getInstance(new Properties())`.

Income-critical paths with zero coverage (code not yet written — expected):
- Stripe webhook handler and subscription state
- User authentication flows
- IM transform (quoted-reply stripping)
- IMAP polling job

No flaky tests. No redundant tests. No test failures.

---

### Role 3 — Growth Strategist
Added 5 new growth tasks to INTERNAL_TODO.md (not previously captured):
1. **Thread permalink sharing** [GROWTH][M] — shareable read-only `/share/{token}` link is a
   viral touchpoint; every person who receives a link gets a demo of the product. HIGH income impact.
2. **Browser push notifications** [GROWTH][S] — Web Push API re-engages users without requiring
   them to keep the tab open; drives daily active usage. MEDIUM income impact.
3. **Slack/Discord webhook integration** [GROWTH][M] — sends a Slack/Discord notification when
   a new email arrives; this is a natural $29/mo Team plan feature gate. HIGH income impact.
4. **Thread export (PDF/HTML)** [GROWTH][M] — freelancers and support teams need to export
   conversations; this is a paid-tier feature gate. MEDIUM income impact.
5. **In-app referral prompt** [GROWTH][S] — triggered after activation milestone (10 threads
   imported); shows tweet + copy-link modal. MEDIUM income impact.

Added 2 [MARKETING] items to TODO_MASTER.md:
- Slack/Discord community for early users
- Channel-specific announcement when webhook integration ships

---

### Role 4 — UX Auditor
No Thymeleaf templates exist yet so no live user flows to walk. All 5 previously flagged UX
issues remain in INTERNAL_TODO.md. Added 2 new UX issues specific to the import service now built:
1. **Import error feedback** [UX][S] — MessagingException/IOException from import currently
   bubbles up as a 500. Needs a user-visible error banner or toast, not a crash page.
2. **IMAP sync status indicator** [UX][S] — thread list should show "last synced X minutes ago"
   so users know whether they're seeing live data; critical for trust in the product.

### Role 5 — Task Optimizer
Audited and rewrote INTERNAL_TODO.md:
- Archived 1 new completed task (Email Import Service) → Done section now has 6 items
- Added 5 new [GROWTH] tasks from Role 3 in priority order (below existing Growth items)
- Added 2 new [UX] tasks from Role 4
- Added 1 new [HEALTH] task: wrap mail exceptions in domain exception
- Confirmed no duplicates across 30 active tasks
- All tasks remain tagged [S/M/L]; no vague or oversized tasks
- No blocked tasks

---

### Role 6 — Health Monitor
Security (no critical issues):
- No hardcoded credentials in any new file
- `MimeMessageParser` handles null Message-ID, null sender, null sent date defensively
- `resolveParticipant` normalises email to lowercase before lookup/storage — prevents duplicate
  Participants from case-variant addresses (e.g. Alice@Test.com vs alice@test.com)
- `importMessage` is idempotent on Message-ID — safe to call from a polling job without
  duplicate-import protection at the job level

Performance:
- `walkParts` recursion depth is bounded by the message structure (typically 2–3 levels);
  no risk of stack overflow for standard RFC 822 messages
- `resolveParticipant` does a SELECT before every INSERT — acceptable for import volumes,
  but may become a bottleneck in bulk-import scenarios (flagged for future batching)
- `resolveThread` does up to N+1 SELECTs for messages in the References list (worst case:
  long References chain with no match). Low risk at current scale; indexed on message_id_header.

Code quality:
- `MimeMessageParser` is package-private (correctly scoped)
- `ParsedEmail` is a record — immutable, no mutable state
- Constructor injection enforced; no `@Autowired` fields
- `(String) part.getContent()` cast in `walkParts` is guarded by `isMimeType("text/plain")`
  and `isMimeType("text/html")` checks — Jakarta Mail guarantees String content for those types

Flagged:
- `MessagingException` and `IOException` leak through `EmailImportService.importMessage()` as
  checked exceptions — added [HEALTH][S] task to wrap in a domain exception
- No rate limiting on import volume per user — will need enforcement when IMAP polling ships

Legal (no change from Run #2 — all items still open in TODO_MASTER.md [LEGAL]).

## 2026-04-26 — Autonomous Run #2

### Role 1 — Feature Implementer
**Tasks completed**: Flyway V1__init.sql + domain entities + Spring Data repositories

Files created:
- `src/main/resources/db/migration/V1__init.sql` — 5 tables (participants, email_threads,
  messages, message_recipients, attachments) with FK constraints and 6 performance indexes.
  SQL is ANSI-standard `GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY` — runs on both H2 (test) and
  PostgreSQL (production) without a compatibility layer.
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/domain/` — 6 files:
  - `Participant.java` — `@Entity`, deduped by email, `@PrePersist` createdAt
  - `EmailThread.java` — `@Entity`, `@OneToMany messages`, `@PrePersist/@PreUpdate` timestamps,
    `addMessage()` helper increments messageCount
  - `Message.java` — `@Entity`, `@ManyToOne thread + sender`, `@OneToMany recipients + attachments`,
    `addRecipient()` / `addAttachment()` helpers
  - `MessageRecipient.java` — `@Entity`, `@ManyToOne message + participant`, `RecipientType` enum
  - `Attachment.java` — `@Entity`, `@ManyToOne message`, blob_ref for storage pointer
  - `RecipientType.java` — enum `TO / CC / BCC`
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/repository/` — 4 interfaces:
  - `ParticipantRepository` — `findByEmail`, `existsByEmail`
  - `EmailThreadRepository` — `findByRootMessageId`, `findAllByOrderByUpdatedAtDesc(Pageable)`
  - `MessageRepository` — `findByMessageIdHeader`, `findByThreadIdOrderBySentAtAsc`
  - `AttachmentRepository` — `findByMessageId`

Verified: `./mvnw test` → BUILD SUCCESS, all tests pass.

**Income relevance**: Domain model and persistence layer are the foundation for all features
that drive revenue — user threads, message history, attachment storage. Nothing billable ships
without this layer.

---

### Role 2 — Test Examiner
**Coverage added**: 10 new tests across 3 test classes (11 total, up from 1).

Files added:
- `ParticipantRepositoryTest` (3 tests): save/find by email, existsByEmail, unique constraint enforcement
- `EmailThreadRepositoryTest` (4 tests): save/find thread, ordered by updatedAt, message persistence, findByMessageIdHeader
- `AttachmentRepositoryTest` (3 tests): save/find by message ID, multiple attachments per message, TO/CC recipient types

Income-critical paths still at zero coverage (code not yet written — expected):
- Stripe webhook handler and subscription state transitions
- User authentication (login, registration, session)
- IMAP ingestion and thread-building logic
- IM transform (quoted-reply stripping)

No flaky tests. No redundant tests. No test failures. Added TEST-FAILURE tagging protocol to
INTERNAL_TODO.md for when those paths are built.

---

### Role 3 — Growth Strategist
Added 5 new implementable growth tasks to INTERNAL_TODO.md:
1. **Google OAuth SSO** [GROWTH][S] — Removes password friction at signup; Gmail users get
   mailbox auto-connected. HIGH income impact. Added credential step to TODO_MASTER.md.
2. **First-run onboarding wizard** [GROWTH][M] — Guided "connect your mailbox" flow.
   Reduces activation drop-off = more users reach the Aha moment = more conversions.
3. **Upgrade prompts at limit** [GROWTH][S] — Inline modal when free tier hits 500 threads
   or 1 mailbox. Direct revenue trigger. HIGH income impact.
4. **Email digest notifications** [GROWTH][M] — Daily/weekly re-engagement email. Reduces
   churn. MEDIUM income impact.
5. **SEO landing page** [GROWTH][M] — Static / with features + pricing. Organic traffic
   from "email as chat" searches. MEDIUM income impact.

Added [MARKETING] Google OAuth ToS review item to TODO_MASTER.md.

---

### Role 4 — UX Auditor
No Thymeleaf templates exist yet so no live user flows to audit. Flagged 5 specific
UX issues for when templates are built (added to INTERNAL_TODO.md tagged [UX]):
1. Thread list empty state — blank page with no CTA when no threads exist
2. Conversation empty state — blank panel when thread has no messages
3. Error pages — Spring Whitelabel error page exposed to users; needs custom error.html
4. Reply button prominence — must be primary action, not buried below message list
5. Mobile layout — 375px viewport pass required for chat bubbles

---

### Role 5 — Task Optimizer
Audited and rewrote INTERNAL_TODO.md:
- Archived 5 completed tasks to Done section
- Organized into sections: Core, Growth/Revenue, UX, Health, Infrastructure
- Consolidated duplicate upgrade-prompt mentions into one task
- Re-prioritized: Core income-blocking features first, then Growth, UX, Health, Infra
- All tasks tagged [S/M/L]; no oversized tasks remain
- No blocked tasks (all dependencies either done or not yet needed)

---

### Role 6 — Health Monitor
Security audit (no issues found):
- No hardcoded credentials in any source file
- `application.yml` prod profile uses env-var placeholders throughout
- No `@Autowired` field injection (constructor injection enforced by convention)
- `open-in-view=false` prevents lazy-load-over-HTTP session leaks

Performance review:
- 6 indexes added in V1__init.sql covering all FK columns and common sort keys
  (`updated_at DESC`, `sent_at DESC`) — N+1 risk on unindexed FKs eliminated at schema level
- `FetchType.LAZY` on all `@ManyToOne` and `@OneToMany` relations — no eager cross-table fetches
- No unbounded list queries; `EmailThreadRepository.findAllByOrderByUpdatedAtDesc` uses `Pageable`

Code quality:
- No dead code; all 6 entity classes and 4 repositories are actively referenced in tests
- `Collections.unmodifiableList()` on collection getters in EmailThread and Message —
  prevents external mutation of managed collections
- No unused dependencies

Dependencies:
- Spring Boot 3.5.14 (latest 3.x); no known CVEs in current dep set
- H2 2.3 (bundled by Spring Boot) — no known issues
- Testcontainers 1.20.4 — current stable

Legal (no change from Run #1):
- Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Refund Policy, Cookie banner still outstanding
- Flagged in TODO_MASTER.md [LEGAL] — no action taken (code-level task; requires Master)

## 2026-04-25 — Autonomous Run #1 (Bootstrap)

### First Run — APP_SPEC.md created
- Defined application: **MailIM** — email-to-instant-message SaaS
- Business model: Freemium subscription ($0 / $9 / $29 / $99 per month)
- Target users: remote workers, support teams, freelancers

### Role 1 — Feature Implementer
**Task implemented**: Scaffold Maven project + Add starters (CLAUDE.md items 2 and 3)

Files created:
- `pom.xml` — Spring Boot 3.5.14, Java 21; starters: web, thymeleaf, data-jpa,
  validation, mail, flyway-core, flyway-database-postgresql; runtime: postgresql;
  test: h2, spring-boot-starter-test, testcontainers-bom, testcontainers-postgresql
- `.mvn/wrapper/maven-wrapper.properties` — Maven 3.9.11
- `mvnw` / `mvnw.cmd` — generated by `mvn wrapper:wrapper`
- `src/main/java/com/emailmessenger/EmailMessengerApplication.java`
- `src/main/resources/application.yml` — dev profile (H2 in-memory) and prod profile
  (PostgreSQL via env vars DB_URL / DB_USER / DB_PASS)
- `src/test/java/com/emailmessenger/EmailMessengerApplicationTests.java`

Verified: `./mvnw test` → BUILD SUCCESS, 1 test, 0 failures.

**Income relevance**: Compiling foundation for all income-generating features.

### Role 2 — Test Examiner
- Reviewed test suite: 1 test (`contextLoads`) passes; application context boots
  correctly against H2 with Flyway (0 migrations, schema empty — expected).
- Income-critical paths with zero test coverage (expected — code not yet written):
  - Stripe payments / billing webhooks
  - User authentication and registration
  - IMAP email ingestion and thread building
  - IM transform (quoted-reply stripping)
- No flaky or redundant tests. No test failures.
- Added test coverage tasks to INTERNAL_TODO.md for when features are built.

### Role 3 — Growth Strategist
Identified highest-leverage income opportunities and added to INTERNAL_TODO.md:
1. **Stripe billing** [GROWTH][M] — direct revenue unlock; no paying users without it
2. **User auth** [GROWTH][M] — prerequisite for billing; needed for multi-tenancy
3. **Plan-limit enforcement** [GROWTH][S] — creates upgrade pressure on free users
4. **Gravatar + initials avatars** [GROWTH][M] — improves perceived quality → conversion
5. **Unread tracking** [GROWTH][S] — engagement + daily active usage driver
6. **Full-text search** [GROWTH][M] — key feature gate for Personal/Team upgrade
7. **Referral link** [GROWTH][S] — viral loop for organic growth

Added marketing actions to TODO_MASTER.md: Product Hunt, directory listings, SEO
content, community posts, waitlist landing page.

### Role 4 — Task Optimizer
- Created INTERNAL_TODO.md with full task backlog in priority order
- Archived completed scaffold tasks
- All tasks tagged by priority, size, and category
- No duplicates found (first run)
- Blocked tasks: none yet

### Role 5 — Health Monitor
Security:
- No hardcoded credentials found in any file
- `application.yml` prod profile uses `${DB_URL}`, `${DB_USER}`, `${DB_PASS}`,
  `${MAIL_HOST}`, `${MAIL_USER}`, `${MAIL_PASS}` env-var placeholders — safe
- No payment flows present yet — no PCI exposure

Performance:
- No entities or queries yet — N+1 analysis deferred to when entities exist
- `spring.jpa.open-in-view=false` set in both profiles (avoids lazy-load antipattern)

Dependencies:
- Spring Boot 3.5.14 (latest 3.x stable as of 2026-04-25)
- No known CVEs flagged in current dep set (Hibernate 6.6.49, Flyway bundled)

Legal (flagged in TODO_MASTER.md [LEGAL]):
- No Privacy Policy page
- No Terms of Service page
- No Refund Policy page
- Cookie consent banner not yet implemented
- All above required before accepting payments or EU/CCPA-covered users

Code quality:
- Only 3 Java files; no dead code, no repeated logic
- `open-in-view=false` already set to prevent common JPA antipattern
